title: "Image Generation Study Group "
excerpt: >-
  With the increase in AI-generated imagery, there has been a surge in workflows
  incorporating models like Stable Diffusion which could have potential
  applications in research.


  Join us for a study group exploring image generation models, giving an overview of how these models work and how workflows can be adapted for research purposes.
---
The goal of this study group is to bring together like-minded people who are interested in using image diffusion models in their research, and who would like to inspire others to do the same. No prior experience in AI, technology, or working with diffusion models is required; our primary aim is to help you kickstart your journey!\
\
The initial study group will bring together a small group in four 2-hour sessions. We’ll work together to bring you expert advice and support, research design best practice, software assistance and the chance to meet others across the university in a similar position.\
\
Following the initial study group, you’ll work with researchers in your own department to spread your AI knowledge further, supported by the Accelerate team.
