title: Next Data Pipelines School - 25-26 September 2023
excerpt: >
  How can researchers design and implement data pipelines for scientific
  research?  Our Data Pipelines for Science School will help scientists  to
  learn how to correctly, efficiently and robustly prepare your datasets for
  machine learning in your scientific projects.


  We are pleased to announce that Accelerate Science will run the Data Pipelines school again in September 2023.

Well-curated and managed data is central to the effective use of AI, in science and elsewhere. How can scientists build the data pipelines they need to accelerate their research with AI?


Accelerate Science’s Data Pipelines for Science School helps scientists overcome such data pipeline challenges by equipping them with the latest best-practice software techniques. It consists of a blend of lectures and labs, with a focus on discussing general principles and case-studies during the lectures, and a focus on hands-on exercises in Python during the labs. Participants also have the opportunity to discuss and share data pipeline issues encountered in their own research with the course instructor and cohort, and to relate it to the course content. The course is open to students and staff at the University of Cambridge.
