Participants will require some background knowledge for this course. We will be looking at Python code and neural networks so familiarity with Python and some knowledge of machine learning and neural networks is required. We won't be coding during the session, but will share code with you for you to work with after the session. 

Tï»¿he workshop is open to researchers at the University of Cambridge.
