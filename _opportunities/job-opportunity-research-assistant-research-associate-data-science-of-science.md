The science of science community uses the tools of science to understand what influences the rate and direction of scientific activity, through interdisciplinary study of the conduct of research. The Data Science of Science project will identify the infrastructures needed to deploy data science and AI for the science of science, and develop tools to support this deployment. The project starts from the hypothesis that a data-enabled understanding of the lifecycle of a research project would deliver value for a range of R&D stakeholders. It will proceed by convening pilot studies that tackle the practical obstacles to deploying data science and AI and that demonstrate the value of data science for science in real-world applications. This might include research to develop innovative methods for data linkage, management, and analysis.
