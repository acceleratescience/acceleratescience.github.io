We are seeking experienced Senior Machine Learning Engineers (SMLE) to lead the development of our software culture.

Role holders will facilitate the application of machine learning for scientific discovery across a range of projects and activities. By providing software engineering support, advising on the development of diverse research projects, and delivering training and mentoring to researchers across the University, successful candidates will help create an environment in which researchers from across domains are empowered to create and support high-quality research software. For example, Senior Machine Learning Engineers will collaborate with researchers and Accelerate's partners across Cambridge to develop research objectives, projects, and proposals, providing strategic advice for research software through routes including the [AI Clinic](<https://acceleratescience.github.io/machine-learning-clinic>). The role-holder will also contribute to teaching activities, including training researchers from across disciplines in core concepts and practical applications of AI. They will act as evangelists for machine learning in science, helping create a community of researchers working on pressing scientific and societal challenges across the University.

We're looking for experienced machine learning engineers who have:

* The specialist knowledge that will allow them to tackle challenges in machine learning development and deployment, including knowledge and experience of core methods in machine learning, data science, and programming.
* A broad range of software skills that they can adapt to diverse challenges.
* The ability to collaborate effectively with scientists from different domains.
* The ability to work independently, with a high degree of self-motivation, including the organisational skills to manage projects.
* Excellent communication skills, and the ability engage audiences with different levels of familiarity with technical concepts.
