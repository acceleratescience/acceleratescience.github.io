As part of a new challenge-led research funding initiative, we’re inviting researchers across the University of Cambridge to submit concept papers setting out their idea for how AI could serve science, citizens, and society.

An ambitious, multidisciplinary programme of challenge-led, AI-enabled innovation supported by AI@Cam will spin up new research teams, develop collaborations with business, policymakers and civil society, and take innovative ideas from the lab to application. Research teams supported by AI@Cam’s AI-deas scheme will have access to funding and research support to scale their work and impact.

To start, we’re inviting researchers across the University of Cambridge to submit concept papers setting out their idea for how AI could serve science, citizens, and society by 09:00 on 6 October 2023. We’ll convene researchers working on connected themes together to establish a challenge-led research programme to drive a step-change in AI research, policy, and practice. We’ll provide start-up funding of £150k, and we’ll work with challenge teams to support their progress.
