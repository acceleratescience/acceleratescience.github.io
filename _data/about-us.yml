  content: The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery will advance the
    frontiers of science through the application of AI. Supported by a donation
    from Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative founded by Eric and Wendy
    Schmidt, the Accelerate Programme will provide young researchers with
    specialised training in AI techniques, equipping them with the skills they
    need to use machine learning and AI to power their research. By pursuing an
    ambitious research agenda that applies machine learning to the scientific
    challenges of the 21st century, the Programme will generate insights that
    accelerate scientific progress and create AI tools that are capable of
    delivering benefits for science and society.
  heading: "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to become an engine for
    scientific discovery across disciplines – from predicting the impact of
    climate change, to using genetic data to create new healthcare treatments,
    and from finding new astronomical phenomena to identifying new materials
    here on Earth. "
