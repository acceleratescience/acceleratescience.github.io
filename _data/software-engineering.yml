    across disciplines, but the software engineering knowhow required for
    supporting researchers is in short supply. Accelerate Science will help fill
    this gap. "

    As machine learning is adopted across disciplines, scientists are faced with
    new software challenges related to implementing and maintaining machine
    learning models. These challenges are becoming a bottleneck to progress. In
    response, Accelerate Science’s software engineering programme will offer
    tailored software support to unblock these bottleneck.


    AI Clinic: Accelerate’s AI Clinic offers expert advice to Cambridge University researchers using AI in their research, helping resolve engineering issues they might encounter when implementing machine learning methods.
