    across disciplines, but the software engineering knowhow required for
    supporting researchers is in short supply. Accelerate Science will help fill
    this gap. "

    As machine learning is adopted across disciplines, scientists are faced with
    new software challenges related to implementing and maintaining machine
    learning models. These challenges are becoming a bottleneck to progress. In
    response, Accelerate Science’s software engineering programme will offer
    tailored software support to unblock these bottleneck.


    Machine Learning Clinic: Accelerate’s Machine Learning Clinic offers expert advice to Cambridge University researchers using AI in their research, helping resolve engineering issues they might encounter when implementing machine learning methods.


    Data Engineering for Science School: In December 2022, Accelerate is offering researchers at Cambridge University the opportunity to join an intensive 5-day Winter School on data science for science.
