    learn how to correctly, efficiently and robustly prepare your datasets for
    machine learning in your scientific projects.

    The Data Pipeline for Science school was originally launched in Winter 2022,
    encouraged by positive feedback and increased demand, we are pleased to
    announce that Accelerate Science will run the school again as the Spring
    School 2023 from the 29th - 30th March.


    Machine learning is an important  tool for researchers across disciplines. Scientists today have access to more data, from a greater range of sources and at greater speed than ever before, and opportunities to extract insights from this data using AI. But before deploying AI, researchers must have a data pipeline that transforms their data into a state that is suitable for the machine learning algorithms being used. 


    These pipelines are important independent research outputs as they enable others to easily inspect, reproduce, refine or extend the scientist’s work. However, implementing data pipelines present numerous software challenges that might be difficult to resolve or even identify to scientists who do not have a significant expertise in software engineering concepts and practices. 


    Such challenges include: how do I ensure the correctness of my pipeline? How do I structure my pipeline in a way that makes it easier for others to reuse and extend? How do I ensure my pipeline is robust enough to deal with different types and volumes of data? How do I document and publish my pipeline? How do I ensure my pipeline adheres to privacy and anonymisation constraints?


    Accelerate Science’s 'Data Pipelines for Science' School helps scientists overcome such data pipeline challenges by equipping them with the latest best-practice software techniques. It consists of a blend of lectures and labs, with a focus on discussing general principles and case-studies during the lectures, and a focus on hands-on exercises in Python during the labs. Participants also have the opportunity to discuss and share data pipeline issues encountered in their own research with the course instructor and cohort, and to relate it to the course content. 


    For a taster of topics covered in the Winter School, watch Dr Soumya Banerjee’s talk on Reproducible Research in R [here. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDSj-jEoaoc)


    The 2022 Winter School took place from 5-7 December and registration is now open for the Spring School running from the 29th - 30th March 2023.

    **FAQs**


    **Who is this course for?**


    Any researcher at the University of Cambridge who works with large datasets in their research and is interested in making the transition to data science-led research, but does not have significant expertise in software or data engineering.


    **How will this course help my research?**


    Any data-intensive research requires implementing data pipelines (even implicitly), and as mentioned in the course overview, this course will help researchers identify and resolve numerous design and implementation challenges that arise when using data pipelines in research. Implementing the methodology taught in this course will help ensure that all your data pipelines and data handling runs efficiently, correctly and can be shared frictionlessly with collaborators; which are beneficial to any scientific research programme.


    **What is the minimum level of programming requirement to participate in the course?**


    There are no minimum programming skills requirements to enrol for the course. However we ask participants to complete an online Python course before the school starts to ensure all enrolled students have the minimum required programming level needed for the course.

    For further details on  how to access the free online course you can visit: <https://acceleratescience.github.io/resources/python-programming-for-science.html>


    **Do you cover any other programming language apart from Python?**


    All the labs will be conducted in Python, however the pipelines concepts discussed can be easily applied to any other language


    **Do I need to be familiar with machine learning to participate?**


    While implementing a data pipeline is an important preparatory step for using machine learning, the focus of this course will be solely on data pipelines and thus you do not need to be familiar with machine learning to participate.
