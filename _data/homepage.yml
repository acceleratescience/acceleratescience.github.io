  title: Accelerate Science
  content: "Amidst growing excitement about AI, a gap has emerged between our
    aspirations for AI and our ability to deploy these technologies to tackle
    real-world challenges. ML@CL aims to bridge this gap through innovations in
    modelling, systems and software engineering for machine learning deployment;
    the application of AI for scientific discovery; and the development of
    policy frameworks for trustworthy and beneficial AI."

  title: About Us
  heading: 
  content: "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to become an engine for scientific discovery across disciplines â€“ from predicting the impact of climate change, to using genetic data to create new healthcare treatments, and from finding new astronomical phenomena to identifying new materials here on Earth. 

The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery will advance the frontiers of science through the application of AI.

Supported by a donation from [Schmidt Futures](https://schmidtfutures.com), a philanthropic initiative founded by Eric and Wendy Schmidt, the Accelerate Programme will provide young researchers with specialised training in AI techniques, equipping them with the skills they need to use machine learning and AI to power their research.

  By pursuing an ambitious research agenda that applies machine learning to the scientific challenges of the 21st century, the Programme will generate insights that accelerate scientific progress and create AI tools that are capable of delivering benefits for science and society."

  title: Research
  heading: Our work addresses the full pipeline of AI system development, from
    data acquisition, through model development to system deployment.
  content: We work closely with practitioners, domain experts and policymakers to
    understand and respond to the real-world challenges associated with AI
    deployment. Our research spans the fundamentals of machine learning methods,
    statistical emulation and uncertainty quantification, real-time inference
    and decision-making, systems design, the application of AI in science and
    industry, data stewardship, and AI policymaking. Find out more about current
    projects on our Research pages.
