      <h3>An AI revolution in science?</h3>
      <p>
<strong>How can we harness the potential of AI to accelerate scientific discovery? Find out more about the frontiers, opportunities and challenges of AI for science at Accelerateâ€™s 2021 Annual Symposium.</strong>
<br />
<br />
        AI has the potential to become an engine for scientific discovery across disciplines. From identifying new phenomena in the stars, to helping understand the materials around us here on Earth, and from mapping the climate system to investigating our genetic code.  
<br />
<br />
Realising these benefits will require new technologies, new collaborations, and new interfaces between AI and the sciences. The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery works to create these connections, developing AI tools and methods that can enhance scientific discovery. To explore recent advances in the application of AI for science and the ways in which the Cambridge community is deploying AI technologies, join us on 19 November for our first Accelerate Science Annual Symposium!
<br />
<br />
Hosted by Professor Neil Lawrence, the event will feature a mix of invited talks and community-led unworkshops. We'll post full details of the agenda here soon.
