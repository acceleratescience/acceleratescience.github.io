      <h3>Accelerate Science's 2021 Annual Symposium</h3>
      <p>
<strong>How can we harness the potential of AI to accelerate scientific discovery? Find out more about the frontiers, opportunities and challenges of AI for science at Accelerate’s 2021 Annual Symposium.</strong>
<br />
<br />
        AI has the potential to become an engine for scientific discovery across disciplines. From identifying new phenomena in the stars, to helping understand the materials around us here on Earth, and from mapping the climate system to investigating our genetic code.  
<br />
<br />
Realising these benefits will require new technologies, new collaborations, and new interfaces between AI and the sciences. The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery works to create these connections, developing AI tools and methods that can enhance scientific discovery. To explore recent advances in the application of AI for science and the ways in which the Cambridge community is deploying AI technologies, join us on 19 November for our first Accelerate Science Annual Symposium!
<br />

<strong>FAQs</strong>
<br />
<br />
<b>What is an unworkshop?</b>
<br />
Unworkshops are a space for conference participants to set the agenda. They can be seminars, talks, or discussion groups, on whatever topics are exciting or interesting to you at the interface of AI and the sciences. At the Accelerate Symposium, our unworkshop session will provide a space for the AI for science community to share ideas. If you’re interested in proposing a session, please fill in the form at this link - <a href="https://forms.gle/p2WXNu43YoDjgN8C8">link here</a> - or contact us at accelerate-science@cst.cam.ac.uk 
<br />
<br />
<b>What support will Accelerate provide to unworkshop convenors?</b>
<br />
The team will provide technical support, along with someone in the session to help guide the discussion or activity. 
<br />
<br />
<b>How long will unworkshops be?</b>
<br />
They will be an hour long. After the hour, we’ll ask workshop leads if they would like to join us in a plenary session that explores the topics covered by their session.  
<br />
<br />
<b>What can I do in a workshop?</b>
<br />
The unworkshop is run at the discretion of the leader. These can be through lectures, seminar format, activities- the session is completely yours to explore.
