  I've recently finished the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science and my interests
  lie in practical and real-world applications of machine learning to solve real
  problems humans are facing. I am currently working under Dr. Sam Nallaperuma
  Herzberg, continuing the research I began during my Master's thesis on
  generating insomnia therapy music using diffusion models. Previously, I've
  worked as an NLP researcher and as a bioinformatician.
