biography: >-
  Carl Henrik is a Senior Lecturer in Machine learning in the Department of
  Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge. Learning is
  the task of creating structure of uncertainty by making assumptions of the
  world. The science of machine learning is concerned with how to formulate
  assumptions into mathematics (modelling) and how to related them to observed
  data (inference). Carl Henrik's research spans both these areas, in specific
  he is interested in how we can create data efficient and interpretable
  assumptions that allows us to learn from small amounts of data.


  Before joining the group in Cambridge Carl Henrik was a Senior Lecturer at the University of Bristol, prior to this he was an Assistant Professor at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. He did my postdoctoral research at University of California at Berkeley and his PhD is from Oxford Brookes University. His undergraduate degree is a MEng degree in Vehicle Engineering from the Royal Institutie of Technology in Stockholm.
