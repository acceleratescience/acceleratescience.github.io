name: Oisin Kim
biography: Oisin's research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical
  physics and machine learning, for example, teaching machines to learn
  mathematical structures. Most recently, he has investigated how machine
  learning can speed up calculations which are important in algebraic geometry
  and string theory. Prior to joining Cambridge, Oisin did the MMath at Oxford,
  where his master's thesis was on deformation quantization.
