biography: >
  Stathis studied Physics at the University of Athens and CERN where he created
  and analysed simulations of supersymmetric field theories. He then completed
  his MSc and PhD at UCLA on physical mathematics and theoretical physics,
  focusing on defining rigorous and exactly solvable models of 2d topological
  quantum gravity equipped with any open/closed Atiyah TQFT and using them to
  derive insights about the black hole information paradox. Stathis joined the
  Teichmann lab in March 2023 as a postdoc, working closely with the Lotfollahi
  lab and joined the Accelerate Science team in December 2024. He is interested
  in the mathematical design of deep learning algorithms for disentangled
  representations and causal inference in single-cell and spatial genomics, with
  an aim at understanding gene regulation and protein-ligand interactions.
