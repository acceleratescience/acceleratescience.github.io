name: Neil D. Lawrence
biography: Neil Lawrence is the inaugural DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning
  at the University of Cambridge. He has been working on machine learning models
  for over 20 years. He recently returned to academia after three years as
  Director of Machine Learning at Amazon. His main interest is the interaction
  of machine learning with the physical world. This interest was triggered by
  deploying machine learning in the African context, where ‘end-to-end’
  solutions are normally required. This has inspired new research directions at
  the interface of machine learning and systems research, this work is funded by
  a Senior AI Fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute. Neil is also visiting
  Professor at the University of Sheffield and the co-host of Talking Machines.
