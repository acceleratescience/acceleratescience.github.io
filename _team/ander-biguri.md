name: Ander Biguri
biography: Ander Biguri is a Research Associate at Department of Applied
  Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, interested in translational research, in
  particular in medical imaging and tomography. He has worked on tomographic
  reconstruction for the last 9 years, trying to bridge the gap between
  mathematics research and applications, by for example developing easy to use
  open-source tools for image reconstruction (github.com/CERN/TIGRE). Nowadays,
  this effort is targeted towards novel machine-learning driven methods to
  solve  tomographic reconstruction.
