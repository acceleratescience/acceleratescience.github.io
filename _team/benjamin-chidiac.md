name: Benjamin Chidiac
biography: Benâ€™s work examines the cross-section of network science,
  neuroimaging, machine learning and omics-related research in the context of
  mental health. This involves exploring how novel, multimodal measures of brain
  connectivity and gene expression data might be combined through AI to better
  characterise psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In
  turn, it is hoped that this will lead to the development of more personalised,
  effective treatment approaches.
