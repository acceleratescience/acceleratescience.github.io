biography: Christian’s research focuses on the intersection of machine learning
  and systems design. He explores how systems perspectives can help develop safe
  and reliable machine learning technologies, combining data-oriented
  architectures with techniques from service-oriented computing and
  self-adaptive systems. He is particularly interested in the application of
  these methods to smart cities.
