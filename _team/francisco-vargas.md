biography: Francisco is a PhD student in the Computer Laboratory. He is
  Interested in the duality between optimisation and sampling with a focus on
  applications. In particular,  exploring stochastic control based methodologies
  (e.g. Schrödinger Bridges) in practical contexts such as Bayesian machine
  learning as well as generative modelling, for example developing better
  samplers for Bayesian Deep Learning.  Overall, he aims to focus on dynamical
  formulations of different learning tasks to explore physically motivated
  efficient algorithms, always keeping the practical/application component as
  the main focus.
