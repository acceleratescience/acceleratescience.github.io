biography: >
  Dinithi is a Research Associate in the Department of Physics and the Wellcome
  Sanger Institute. Dinithi is studying machine learning models for trajectory
  analysis and comparison in single-cell genomics data. A main focus is to
  develop alignment models of in vivo and in vitro cell differentiation
  trajectories for generating insights into refining in vitro protocols. She is
  interested in unravelling the differential transcription factors and genes
  that play crucial roles in deciding different cell fates.
