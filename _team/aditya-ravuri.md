biography: Aditya is interested in probabilistic machine learning, specifically
  in situations where there is interesting prior information available. As
  Gaussian processes routinely lend themselves to such applications, he enjoys
  working with them. He is also interested in finding a statistical basis for
  some classical algorithms.
