biography: "Siyuan is a PhD student with Ferenc Huszár at University of Cambridge and Bernhard Schölkopf at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.
  She is a fellow under Cambridge-Tübingen fellowship and funded by Premium Research Studentship. Her research interest lies in the intersection of
  causal inference and machine learning. She is interested in exploring how to transfer from traditional prediction-based ML algorithms to non i.i.d ML tasks, such that
  we can have more robust and fair ML algorithms. Previously, she studied Machine Learning
  (MSc) at UCL and Mathematics (BA + MSc) at Cambridge. She also worked as a quantitative strategist in Goldman Sachs International."
