  I am a second-year PhD student at the Cambridge Intellectual and developmental
  Disabilities Research Group (CIDDRG). Prior to that, I received an MSc degree
  in Robotics and Computation from University College London and a BEng in
  Electronic Engineering from King’s College London.

  My PhD project focuses on using machine learning techniques to integrate domain-specific knowledge of Alzheimer’s Disease for early diagnosis and prognosis tasks in the general population and Down Syndrome cohort.
