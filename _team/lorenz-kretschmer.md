biography: >-
  Lorenz is a clinician scientist, who is interested in understanding the single
  cell architecture of the human immune system. In his research, he combines
  single cell multi-omics sequencing and computational techniques to generate
  new insights into the epigenetic regulation of different immune cells. Machine
  learning is implemented at several stages of single cell multi-omics data
  analysis. 
   
  Before joining the Accelerate Programme, Lorenz trained as a medical microbiologist, virologist and infection epidemiologist at the Technical University of Munich (TUM, Germany). During his time at TUM, he investigated basic aspects regarding memory CD8 T cell development.
