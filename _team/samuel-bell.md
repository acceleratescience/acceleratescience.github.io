  Sam applies the principles and methods of psychology to understanding neural
  network behaviour.


  He is a machine learning PhD student in the ML@CL group at the University of Cambridge (Queens’ College), supervised by Prof. Neil Lawrence. During his master’s he worked on deep learning and natural language processing at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory. He did my bachelor’s in computer science at the University of Manchester, graduating 2013.


  In between, Sam has also simulated financial crises in market risk at Goldman Sachs, built new retail banks at Thought Machine, and developed next generation credit scores at Credit Kudos.


  He is also the Founder and Chair of The Preptrack Foundation, a registered charity building technology for HIV prevention. Their first app, [Preptrack](https://preptrack.co.uk/), helps people who use PrEP, the medication that eliminates risk of HIV infection.
