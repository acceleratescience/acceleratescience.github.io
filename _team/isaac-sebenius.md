biography: |
  Isaac is interested in developing new computational methods that
  leverage biological knowledge to address open questions related to mental
  health and psychiatric disorders. In particular, Isaacâ€™s work seeks to
  characterize and predict the spectrum of psychotic disorders by using machine
  learning to combine multiple types of neuroimaging-derived brain connectivity
  as well as genetic and other biological data.
