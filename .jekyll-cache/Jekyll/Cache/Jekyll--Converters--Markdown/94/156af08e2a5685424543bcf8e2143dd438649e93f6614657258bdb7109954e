I"≠<p>Siyuan is a PhD student with Ferenc Husz√°r at University of Cambridge and Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. She is a fellow under Cambridge-T√ºbingen fellowship and funded by Premium Research Studentship. Her research interest lies in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning. She is interested in exploring how to transfer from traditional prediction-based ML algorithms to non i.i.d ML tasks, such that we can have more robust and fair ML algorithms. Previously, she studied Machine Learning (MSc) at UCL and Mathematics (BA + MSc) at Cambridge. She also worked as a quantitative strategist in Goldman Sachs International.</p>
