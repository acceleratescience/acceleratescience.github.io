I"¯<p>Ferenc finished my PhD in Machine Learning at theÂ Cambridge University Engineering Department in 2013. At that time he worked on Bayesian inference, nonparametric and kernel methods. Since then, he has worked in the London technology sector: in various tech startups and briefly in venture capital. He served as Principal Research Scientist at deep learning startup Magic Pony Technology, focussed on applying machine learning to the problem of lossy image and video compression. Following the acquisition of Magic Pony by Twitter in 2016, he served as Senior Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter where he worked on a range of ML-related projects including computer vision, recommender systems and ML ethics and fairness. He joined the Department of Computer Science and Technology in 2020 as a Senior Lecturer and continues to advise Twitterâ€™s ML Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team as a staff research scientist.</p>
