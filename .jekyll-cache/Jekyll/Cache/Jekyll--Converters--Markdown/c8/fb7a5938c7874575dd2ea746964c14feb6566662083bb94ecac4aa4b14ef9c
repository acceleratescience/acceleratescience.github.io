I"ù<p>Carl Henrik is a Senior Lecturer in Machine learning in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge. Learning is the task of creating structure of uncertainty by making assumptions of the world. The science of machine learning is concerned with how to formulate assumptions into mathematics (modelling) and how to related them to observed data (inference). My research spans both these areas, in specific I am interested in how we can create data efficient and interpretable assumptions that allows us to learn from small amounts of data.</p>

<p>Before joining the group in Cambridge I was a Senior Lecturer at the University of Bristol, prior to this I was an Assistant Professor at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. I did my postdoctoral research at University of California at Berkeley and my PhD is from Oxford Brookes University. My undergraduate degree is a MEng degree in Vehicle Engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.</p>
