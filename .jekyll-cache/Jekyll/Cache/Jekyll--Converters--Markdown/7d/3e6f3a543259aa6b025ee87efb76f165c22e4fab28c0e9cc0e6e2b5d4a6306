I"z<p>Bianca works at the intersection of machine learning and genetics. Her main research interest is understanding how local molecular rules give raise to emergent spatial patterns in the context of biological dynamical systems. To this end, she uses techniques from statistical optimization, statistical physics and domain adaptation to identify contextual phenotypes in spatial transcriptomic data and to understand the identity of single cells and their interactions in early development. She is also interested in active learning and graphical neural networks as models to study the effects and side-effects of drug cocktails.</p>
