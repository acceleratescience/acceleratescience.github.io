  Challenger is a Theoretical Physicist working on the problem of Quantum Gravity. He is developing machine-driven approaches to problems in String Theory and related Calabi-Yau geometries, studying the vast landscape of String Theory solutions using a combination of tools and techniques from machine learning and mathematical physics. These include differential and algebraic geometry, invariant theory, symbolic regression, and equivariant architectures. He is also developing new machine learning architectures and methodologies inspired by mathematical physics. These approaches will deepen understandings of the map between String Theory models and the Standard Model of particle physics.
