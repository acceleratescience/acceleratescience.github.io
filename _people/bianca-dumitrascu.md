biography: Bianca works at the intersection of machine learning and genetics.
  Her main research interest is understanding how local molecular rules give
  raise to emergent spatial patterns in the context of biological dynamical
  systems. To this end, she uses techniques from statistical optimization,
  statistical physics and domain adaptation to identify contextual phenotypes in
  spatial transcriptomic data and to understand the identity of single cells and
  their interactions in early development. She is also interested in active
  learning and graphical neural networks as models to study the effects and
  side-effects of drug cocktails.
