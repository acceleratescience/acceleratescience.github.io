biography: Jess is Executive Director of the Accelerate Programme for Scientific
  Discovery, and Director of the Data Trusts Initiative. She has a range of
  collaborations in areas where AI is being used to tackle real-world
  challenges. These explore the roles that technological advances, scientific
  evidence, policy development and public dialogue can play in sharing the
  benefits of AI technologies across society. Her interests in AI and its
  consequences for science and society stem from her policy career, in which she
  worked with senior parliamentarians, leading researchers and civil society
  organisations to bring scientific evidence to bear on major policy issues.
