biography: |
  Sam is a senior postdoctoral researcher at the Department of
  Computer Science and an AI for Science Fellow. Sam contributes to
  interdisciplinary research with her experience in artificial
  intelligence, collaborating across multiple disciplines to solve
  real world problems to reach sustainable development goals.

  Sam is passionate about supporting underrepresented groups and
  students from disadvantaged backgrounds to reach their full
  potential. To this end, she co-founded "Sumithra foundation to
  support education" aiming to end child poverty. She extends this
  contribution by forming a network for current and future generation
  of female tech entrepreneurs: a group who has a great potential but
  is severely underrepresented in the current entrepreneurial space.
