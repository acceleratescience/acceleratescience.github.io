biography: Sarah's research applies machine learning, network science and
  Natural Language Processing to better understand and predict mental health
  conditions. A main focus is using brain connectivity derived from MRI to
  predict disease trajectories for patients with schizophrenia. Sarah is also
  interested in using transcribed speech data to perform similar prediction
  problems.
