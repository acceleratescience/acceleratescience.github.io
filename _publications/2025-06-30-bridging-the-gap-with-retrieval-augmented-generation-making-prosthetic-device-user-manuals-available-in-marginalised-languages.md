title: "Bridging the Gap with Retrieval-Augmented Generation:  Making Prosthetic
  Device User Manuals Available in  Marginalised Languages "
abstract: Millions of people in African countries face barriers to accessing
  healthcare due to language and literacy gaps. This research tackles this
  challenge by transforming complex medical documents—in this case, prosthetic
  device user manuals—into accessible formats for underserved populations. This
  case study in cross-cultural translation is particularly pertinent/relevant
  for communities that receive donated prosthetic devices but may not receive
  the accompanying user documentation. Or, if available online, may only be
  available in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to
  local populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural
  context). The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect,
  but our open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy
  extension to other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI powered
  framework designed to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g.,
  user manuals for prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system
  enables users—such as healthcare workers or patients—to upload
  English-language medical equipment manuals, pose questions in their native
  language, and receive accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically,
  the system integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for
  processing and semantic understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs
  advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question
  answering and multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures
  accessibility to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety
  information, empowering patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare
  decisions. This framework supports integrating additional languages, making it
  adaptable to a wide range of global health challenges, including public health
  campaigns and disaster relief, where accurate communication in native
  languages can save lives. With far-reaching implications, this research serves
  as an interim solution for health organisations/providers in such communities
  and a call to action for policymakers and governments of the Global South to
  reduce inequities in accessing critical medical information. Overall, it
  offers a vision of healthcare that empowers marginalised communities, fosters
  trust, and ensures no one is left behind due to language or literacy barriers.
