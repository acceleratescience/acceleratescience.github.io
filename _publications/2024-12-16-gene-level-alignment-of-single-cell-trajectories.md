title: Gene-level alignment of single-cell trajectories
abstract: "This paper presents Genes2Genes, a new Bayesian information-theoretic
  alignment framework for single-cell pseudotime trajectories. It demonstrates
  the utility of trajectory alignment for disease cell-state analysis and in
  vitro vs. in vivo comparative studies for organoid protocol refinement.
  Genes2Genes was developed as an open source Python package available at:
  https://github.com/Teichlab/Genes2Genes."
