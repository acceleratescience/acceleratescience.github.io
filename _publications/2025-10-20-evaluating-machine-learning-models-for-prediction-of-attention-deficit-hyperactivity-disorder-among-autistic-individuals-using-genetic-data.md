title: Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Prediction of Attention Deficit
  Hyperactivity Disorder among Autistic Individuals Using Genetic Data
abstract: >-
  

  With the change in classification systems in the last 12 years, it has become possible to make diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in autistic individuals. With this has come increasing awareness that autistic individuals with co-occurring ADHD experience additional challenges. Nevertheless, ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition which is amenable to behavioural and pharmacological interventions, especially when identified early. Prediction algorithms often utilise regression methods which have limited decision boundaries. This study thus aimed to evaluate the utility of machine learning methods in combination with genetic data to predict co-occurring ADHD among autistic individuals.
