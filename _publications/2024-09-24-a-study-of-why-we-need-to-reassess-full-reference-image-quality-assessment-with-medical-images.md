title: A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality
  assessment with medical images
abstract: The paper highlights that the commonly used metrics for image quality
  assessment, SSIM and PSNR, do a poor job at selecting the best medical images
  in 8 different clinical scenarios. These metrics may be of use for natural
  images, but optimizing their performance for medical images is undesirable, in
  general.
