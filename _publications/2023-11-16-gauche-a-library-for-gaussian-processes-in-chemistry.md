title: Mathematical conjecture generation using machine intelligence
abstract: Conjectures have historically played an important role in the
  development of pure mathematics. This paper proposes a systematic approach to
  finding abstract patterns in mathematical data, in order to generate
  conjectures about mathematical inequalities, using machine intelligence and
  propose a pipeline of mathematical discovery in this space highlighting the
  importance of domain expertise
