title: "GAUCHE: A library for Gaussian processes in chemistry"
abstract: GAUCHE is a library for GAUssian processes in CHEmistry. Gaussian
  processes have long been a cornerstone of probabilistic machine learning,
  affording particular advantages for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian
  optimisation. Through this paper the team seek to extend Gaussian processes to
  chemical representations and showcase applications for GAUCHE in molecular
  discovery and chemical reaction optimisation. The codebase is made available
