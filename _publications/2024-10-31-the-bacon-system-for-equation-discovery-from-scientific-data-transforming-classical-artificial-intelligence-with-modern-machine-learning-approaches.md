title: "The BACON system for equation discovery from scientific data:
  Transforming classical artificial intelligence with modern machine learning
  approaches"
abstract: BACON is a heuristic-based computational scientific discovery system,
  which aims to find invariants in multivariable systems. In this paper, the
  authors demonstrate how they have rebuilt BACON in a modern computing
  language, and we improve the noise-resilience of BACON.  The framework is
  applied to a number of exemplar problems in physics and mathematics. The
  authors suggest that there is potential in these forgotten approaches that
  modern deep learning systems can learn from.
