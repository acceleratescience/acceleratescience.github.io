title: "Trajectory generation for ROI expansion in dental CBCT imaging: An
  out-of-FOV ROI annotation guided arc scan-based approach"
abstract: This study introduces a novel optimization approach for
  source-detector trajectories, designed to simultaneously extend the small
  dental [CBCT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/tomography
  "Learn more about CBCT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") [field
  of
  view](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/field-of-view
  "Learn more about field of view from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic
  Pages") (FOV) at specific regions of interest (ROIs) while reducing radiation
  dose. The proposed algorithm automatically customizes and produces a
  mechanically feasible arc-based scan trajectory to target predefined ROIs,
  expanding the FOV beyond the standard range while utilizing only the necessary
  projections to reconstruct the region of interest, rather than those required
  for reconstruction of the entire volume. This approach enables a significant
  reduction in the number of projections. Both qualitative and quantitative
  analyses, including peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values greater than 30
  dB and structural [similarity
  index](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/similarity-index
  "Learn more about similarity index from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic
  Pages") measure (SSIM) scores above 0.9, demonstrate that the method
  successfully enhances the FOV while maintaining high image quality. Notably,
  the approach achieves a significant reduction in the number of projections up
  to 47% compared to the conventional limited-angle [circular
  trajectory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/circular-trajectory

  FOV and radiation dose reduction in
  dental [CBCT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/tomography
  "Learn more about CBCT from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic

  outcomes and treatment planning in
  next-generation [CBCT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/tomography
