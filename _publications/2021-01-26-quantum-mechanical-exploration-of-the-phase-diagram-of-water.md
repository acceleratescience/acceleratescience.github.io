title: Quantum-Mechanical Exploration of the Phase Diagram of Water
abstract: The set of known stable phases of water may not be complete, and some
  of the phase boundaries between them are fuzzy. Starting from liquid water and
  a comprehensive set of 50 ice structures, we compute the phase diagram at
  three hybrid density-functional-theory levels of approximation, accounting for
  thermal and nuclear fluctuations as well as proton disorder. Such calculations
  are only made tractable because we combine machine-learning methods and
  advanced free-energy techniques. The computed phase diagram is in qualitative
  agreement with experiment, particularly at pressures ≲ 8000 bar, and the
  discrepancy in chemical potential is comparable with the subtle uncertainties
  introduced by proton disorder and the spread between the three hybrid
  functionals. None of the hypothetical ice phases considered is
  thermodynamically stable in our calculations, suggesting the completeness of
  the experimental water phase diagram in the region considered. Our work
  demonstrates the feasibility of predicting the phase diagram of a polymorphic
  system from first principles and provides a thermodynamic way of testing the
  limits of quantum-mechanical calculations.
