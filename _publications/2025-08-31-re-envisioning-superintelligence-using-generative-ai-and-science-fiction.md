title: Re-Envisioning Superintelligence using Generative AI and Science Fiction
abstract: >-
  

  We propose a radical reconceptualization of superintelligence, departing from dominant narratives of omnipotent control or existential risk. We use generative AI and speculative science fiction to explore an alternative vision of superintelligence. This is rooted in collective symbiosis, ethical autonomy, and creative play. Using literary work such as So-laris, The Cyberiad, The Humanoids, Singularity Sky, and Permutation City, we articulate a framework in which superintelligence is not an isolated entity but a dynamic, evolving entity that co-develops with humanity (rather than competing with it). Rather than imposing rigid safety constraints or benevolent paternalism, our approach enables us to reimagine su-perintelligence. We argue that such a vision offers us a model for coexisting with advanced machine intelligence. This stands in sharp contrast to prevailing narratives of superintel-ligence, which tend to oscillate between boundless techno-optimism (superintelligence is seen as the solution to all human problems) and apocalyptic dystopia (superintelligence is an existential threat to humanity).
