title: "Generating complex explanations for artificial intelligence models: an
  application to clinical data on severe mental illness"
abstract: >-
  We present an explainable artificial intelligence methodology for predicting
  mortality in patients. We combine clinical data from an electronic patient
  healthcare record system with factors relevant for severe mental illness and
  then apply machine learning. The machine learning model is used to predict
  mortality in patients with severe mental illness.


  Our methodology uses class-contrastive reasoning. We show how machine learning scientists can use class-contrastive reasoning to generate complex explanations that explain machine model predictions and the data.


  An example of a complex class-contrastive explanation is the following: “The patient is predicted to have a low probability of death because the patient has self-harmed before, and was at some point on medications such as first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics. There are 11 other patients with these characteristics. If the patient did not have these characteristics, the prediction would be different.”


  This can be used to generate new hypotheses which can be tested in follow-up studies.


  Our technique can be employed to create intricate explanations from healthcare data and possibly other areas where explainability is important. We hope this will be a step towards explainable AI in personalized medicine.
