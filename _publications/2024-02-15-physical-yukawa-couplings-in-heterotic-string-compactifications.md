title: Physical Yukawa Couplings in Heterotic String Compactifications
abstract: One of the challenges of heterotic compactification on a Calabi-Yau
  threefold is to determine the physical (27)3 Yukawa couplings of the resulting
  four-dimensional N=1 theory. In general, the calculation necessitates
  knowledge of the Ricci-flat metric. However, in the standard embedding, which
  references the tangent bundle, we can compute normalized Yukawa couplings from
  the Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space of complex structure
  deformations of the Calabi-Yau manifold. In various examples (the Fermat
  quintic, the intersection of two cubics in P5, and the Tian-Yau manifold), we
  calculate the normalized Yukawa couplings for (2,1)-forms using the
  Weil-Petersson metric obtained from the Kodaira-Spencer map. In cases
  where h1,1=1, this is compared to a complementary calculation based on
  performing period integrals. A third expression for the normalized Yukawa
  couplings is obtained from a machine learned approximate Ricci-flat metric
  making use of explicit harmonic representatives. The excellent agreement
  between the different approaches opens the door to precision string
  phenomenology.
