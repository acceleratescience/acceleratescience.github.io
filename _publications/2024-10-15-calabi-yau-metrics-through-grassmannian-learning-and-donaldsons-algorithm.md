title: Calabi-Yau metrics through Grassmannian learning and Donaldson's algorithm
abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the problem of numerical Kähler
  metrics, the authors survey machine learning techniques in this area,
  discussing both advantages and drawbacks. The authors present a novel approach
  to obtaining Ricci-flat approximations to Kähler metrics, applying machine
  learning within a `principled' framework. In particular, they use gradient
  descent on the Grassmannian manifold to identify an efficient subspace of
  sections for calculation of the metric. This approach is combined with both
  Donaldson's algorithm and learning on the h-matrix itself. The methods are
  implemented on the Dwork family of threefolds, commenting on the behaviour at
  different points in moduli space.
