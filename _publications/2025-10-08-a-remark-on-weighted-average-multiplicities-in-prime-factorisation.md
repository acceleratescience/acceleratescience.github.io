title: A remark on weighted average multiplicities in prime factorisation
abstract: We study a generalisation of the quality of an ABC triple that we call
  the weighted average multiplicity (WAM), in which the logarithmic heights of
  prime factors are raised to a complex exponent s. The WAM is connected to the
  standard ABC conjecture at s = 1. We show that for real part of s less than 1,
  WAM is unbounded over ABC triples both for integers and polynomials. For real
  part greater than 1, we characterise a boundary beyond which WAM is
  holomorphic and bounded. In this region, we show that WAM is related to the
  multiplicity of the largest prime factor of the triple, a quantity that we
  connect with the original ABC conjecture and whose distribution we explore
  computationally.
