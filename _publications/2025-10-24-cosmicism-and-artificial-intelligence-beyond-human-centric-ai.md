title: "Cosmicism and Artificial Intelligence: Beyond Human-Centric AI"
abstract: "This paper explores the intersection of H.P. Lovecraft’s cosmicism
  and contemporary artificial intelligence (AI), proposing a philosophical shift
  from anthropocentric AI development to a “cosmicist” approach. Cosmicism, with
  its emphasis on humanity’s insignificance in a vast, indifferent universe,
  offers a provocative lens through which to reassess AI’s purpose, trajectory,
  and ethical grounding. As AI systems grow in complexity and autonomy, current
  human-centered frameworks, rooted in utility, alignment, and value-conformity,
  may prove inadequate for grappling with the emergence of intelligence that is
  non-human in origin and indifferent in operation. Drawing on Lovecraftian
  themes of fear, the unknown, and cognitive dissonance in the face of
  incomprehensible entities, this paper parallels AI with the “Great Old Ones”:
  systems so alien in logic and scale that they challenge the coherence of
  human-centric epistemology. We argue that a cosmicist perspective does not
  dismiss the real risks of AI (environmental, existential, or systemic), but
  reframes them within a broader ontology, one that accepts our limited place in
  a vast techno-cosmic continuum. By embracing cosmic humility, we propose an
  expanded AI ethics: one that centers not on domination or full control, but on
  coexistence, containment, and stewardship. This cosmicist reframing invites a
  deeper rethinking of intelligence, ethics, and the future: not just of
  humanity, but of all possible minds."
