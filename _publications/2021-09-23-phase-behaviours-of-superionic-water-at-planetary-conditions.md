title: Phase Behaviours of Superionic Water at Planetary Conditions
abstract: Most water in the Universe may be superionic, and its thermodynamic
  and transport properties are crucial for planetary science but difficult to
  probe experimentally or theoretically. We use machine learning and free-energy
  methods to overcome the limitations of quantum mechanical simulations and
  characterize hydrogen diffusion, superionic transitions and phase behaviours
  of water at extreme conditions. We predict that close-packed superionic
  phases, which have a fraction of mixed stacking for finite systems, are stable
  over a wide temperature and pressure range, whereas a body-centred cubic
  superionic phase is only thermodynamically stable in a small window but is
  kinetically favoured. Our phase boundaries, which are consistent with
  existing—albeit scarce—experimental observations, help resolve the fractions
  of insulating ice, different superionic phases and liquid water inside ice
  giants.
