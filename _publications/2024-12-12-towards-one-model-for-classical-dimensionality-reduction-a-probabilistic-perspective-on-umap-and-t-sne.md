title: "Towards One Model for Classical Dimensionality Reduction: A
  Probabilistic Perspective on UMAP and t-SNE"
abstract: This paper shows that the dimensionality reduction methods, UMAP and
  t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a
  generalized Wishart-based model introduced in ProbDR. This interpretation
  offers deeper theoretical insights into these algorithms, while introducing
  tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.
