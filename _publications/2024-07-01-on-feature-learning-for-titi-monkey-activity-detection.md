title: On Feature Learning for Titi Monkey Activity Detection
abstract: This paper introduces a robust machine learning framework for the
  detection of vocal activities of Coppery titi monkeys. Utilizing a combination
  of MFCC features and a bidirectional LSTM-based classifier, the authors
  effectively address the challenges posed by the small amount of
  expert-annotated vocal data available. This approach significantly reduces
  false positives and improves the accuracy of call detection in bioacoustic
  research. Initial results demonstrate an accuracy of 95% on instance
  predictions, highlighting the effectiveness of our model in identifying and
  classifying complex vocal patterns in environmental audio recordings.
  Moreover, the authors show how call classification can be done downstream,
  paving the way for real-world monitoring.
