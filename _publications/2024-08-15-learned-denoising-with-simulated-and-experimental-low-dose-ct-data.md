title: Learned denoising with simulated and experimental low-dose CT data
abstract: This paper analyses what happens when artificial noise is added to
  experimental data at the same level of real noise, and cross-compare AI methos
  trained in each. The authors showcase that even the most sophisticated of the
  "fast" X-ray noise simulators do not capture the complexity of real noise, and
  thus any model trained with such simulated noise may not generalize to real
  data.
