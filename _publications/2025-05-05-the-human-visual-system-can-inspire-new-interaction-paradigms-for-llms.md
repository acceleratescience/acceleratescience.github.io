title: The Human Visual System Can Inspire New Interaction Paradigms for LLMs
abstract: The dominant metaphor of LLMs-as-minds leads to misleading conceptions
  of machine agency and is limited in its ability to help both users and
  developers build the right degree of trust and understanding for outputs from
  LLMs. It makes it harder to disentangle hallucinations from useful model
  interactions. This position paper argues that there are fundamental
  similarities between visual perception and the way LLMs process and present
  language. These similarities inspire a metaphor for LLMs which could open new
  avenues for research into interaction paradigms and shared representations.
  Our visual system metaphor introduces possibilities for addressing these
  challenges by understanding the information landscape assimilated by LLMs.
