title: Advection Augmented Convolutional Neural Networks
abstract: Many problems in physical sciences are characterized by the prediction
  of space-time sequences. Modern techniques for the solution of these problems
  typically combine Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture with a time
  prediction mechanism. However, oftentimes, such approaches underperform in the
  long-range propagation of information and lack explainability. In this work,
  the authors introduce a physically inspired architecture for the solution of
  such problems. Namely, they propose to augment CNNs with advection by
  designing a novel semi-Lagrangian push operator and show that the proposed
  operator allows for the non-local transformation of information compared with
  standard convolutional kernels.
