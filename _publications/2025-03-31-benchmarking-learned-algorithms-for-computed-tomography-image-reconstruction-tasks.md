title: Benchmarking learned algorithms for computed tomography image
  reconstruction tasks
abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a widely used non-invasive diagnostic
  method in various fields, and recent advances in deep learning have led to
  significant progress in CT image reconstruction. However, the lack of
  large-scale, open-access datasets has hindered the comparison of different
  types of learned methods. To address this gap, we use the 2DeteCT dataset, a
  real-world experimental computed tomography dataset, for benchmarking machine
  learning based CT image reconstruction algorithms. We categorize these methods
  into post-processing methods, learned/unrolled iterative methods, learned
  regularizer methods, and plug-and-play methods, and provide a pipeline for
  easy implementation and evaluation. Using key performance metrics, including
  SSIM and PSNR, our benchmarking results showcase the effectiveness of various
  algorithms on tasks such as full data reconstruction, limited-angle
  reconstruction, sparse-angle reconstruction, low-dose reconstruction, and
  beam-hardening corrected reconstruction. With this benchmarking study, we
  provide an evaluation of a range of algorithms representative for different
  categories of learned reconstruction methods on a recently published dataset
  of real-world experimental CT measurements. The reproducible setup of methods
  and CT image reconstruction tasks in an open-source toolbox enables
  straightforward addition and comparison of new methods later on. The toolbox
  also provides the option to load the 2DeteCT dataset differently for
  extensions to other problems and different CT reconstruction tasks.
