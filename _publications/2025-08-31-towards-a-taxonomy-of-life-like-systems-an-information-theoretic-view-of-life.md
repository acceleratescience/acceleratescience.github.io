title: "Towards a taxonomy of life-like systems: An information theoretic view
  of life"
abstract: 'Information plays a critical role in complex biological systems. This
  article proposes a role for information processing in life, lifelike systems
  and intelligence. I hypothesize that carbon-based life forms are only one
  amongst a continuum of lifelike systems in the Universe. Investigations into
  computational substrates that allow information processing is important and
  could yield insights into novel non-carbon based computational substrates that
  may have "life-like" properties. I hypothesize that the key components of a
  computational view of life, lifelike systems and intelligence are: 1)
  Information processing, 2) information storage (memory), 3) a physical
  substrate (hardware), 4) information transfer (across both physical space and
  time), 5) persistence of information across space and time (selection and
  heredity), and 6) availability of energy. We know a lot about life as we know
  it (carbon based life)? How would we recognise life and intelligence as we do
  not know it? Life elsewhere in the Universe may be very different from what we
  see on Earth. Our conception of life and intelligence are very
  anthropocentric. We present a taxonomy of lifelike systems, ranging from
  computer viruses to supernovae, that lie on a continuum. A computational view
  of lifelike systems may allow us to recognise life in all its myriad forms in
  this Universe. We also present outreach resources that the general public and
  students can use to engage with some of these ideas. Life may exist as a
  continuum between non-life and life, and we may have to revise our notion of
  life and how common it is in the Universe. Looking at lifelike phenomena and
  intelligence through the lens of computation may yield a broader view of life
  and intelligence'
