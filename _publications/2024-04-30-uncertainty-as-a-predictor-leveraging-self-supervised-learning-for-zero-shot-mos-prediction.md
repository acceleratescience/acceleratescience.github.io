title: "Uncertainty as a predictor: Leveraging self-supervised learning for
  zero-shot mos prediction"
abstract: Predicting audio quality in voice synthesis and conversion systems is
  a critical yet challenging task, especially when traditional methods like Mean
  Opinion Scores (MOS) are cumbersome to collect at scale. This paper addresses
  the gap in efficient audio quality prediction, especially in low-resource
  settings where extensive MOS data from large-scale listening tests may be
  unavailable. The authors demonstrate that uncertainty measures derived from
  out-of-the-box pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models, such as
  wav2vec, correlate with MOS scores. The paper explores the extent of this
  correlation across different models and language contexts, revealing insights
  into how inherent uncertainties in SSL models can serve as effective proxies
  for audio quality assessment.
