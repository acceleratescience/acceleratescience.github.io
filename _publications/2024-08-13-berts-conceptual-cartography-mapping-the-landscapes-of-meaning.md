title: "BERT's Conceptual Cartography: Mapping the Landscapes of Meaning"
abstract: In this paper, the authors bring tools from natural language
  processing into the domain of conceptual engineering, a branch of philosophy
  dealing with how to change public usage of words and phrases. The authors use
  the spoken component of the British National Corpus and BERT to create
  contextualised word embeddings, and use Gaussian Mixture Models, a selection
  of metrics, and qualitative analysis to visualise and numerically represent
  lexical landscapes.
