title: "Beyond Quantification: Navigating Uncertainty in Professional AI Systems"
abstract: The growing integration of large language models across professional
  domains transforms how experts make critical decisions in healthcare,
  education, and law. While significant research effort focuses on getting these
  systems to communicate their outputs with probabilistic measures of
  reliability, many consequential forms of uncertainty in professional contexts
  resist such quantification. A physician pondering the appropriateness of
  documenting possible domestic abuse, a teacher assessing cultural sensitivity,
  or a mathematician distinguishing procedural from conceptual understanding all
  face forms of uncertainty that cannot be reduced to percentages. This paper
  argues for moving beyond simple quantification toward richer expressions of
  uncertainty essential for beneficial AI integration. We propose participatory
  refinement processes through which professional communities collectively shape
  how different forms of uncertainty are communicated. Our approach acknowledges
  that uncertainty expression is a form of professional sense-making that
  requires collective development rather than algorithmic optimization.
