title: "cymyc: Calabi-Yau Metrics, Yukawas, and Curvature"
abstract: We introduce cymyc, a high-performance Python library for numerical
  investigation of the geometry of a large class of string compactification
  manifolds and their associated moduli spaces. We develop a well-defined
  geometric ansatz to numerically model tensor fields of arbitrary degree on a
  large class of Calabi-Yau manifolds. cymyc includes a machine learning
  component which incorporates this ansatz to model tensor fields of interest on
  these spaces by finding an approximate solution to the system of partial
  differential equations they should satisfy.
