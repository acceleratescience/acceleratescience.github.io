title: "Intelligence in animals, humans and machines: a heliocentric view of
  intelligence? "
abstract: >-
  We argue that current conceptions of intelligence are anthropocentric. Looking
  at intelligence in both biological and artificial (human-engineered) systems
  can yield a more sobering and nuanced view of intelligence.


  We will explore why we care about measuring the intelligence of AI systems, what we mean by the word “intelligence” in different contexts, and why AI systems may think very differently from humans.
