title: "Moving beyond word error rate to evaluate automatic speech recognition
  in clinical samples: Lessons from research into schizophrenia-spectrum
  disorders"
abstract: "Natural language processing applications to mental health research
  depend on automatic speech recognition (ASR) to study large samples and
  develop scalable clinical tools. To ensure safe and effective implementation,
  it is crucial to understand performance patterns of ASR for speech from
  clinical populations. Therefore, this study evaluated ASR performance in N=50
  speech samples from individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders,
  identifying word error rates (WER) ranging from 0.31 to 0.58. Different WER
  showed systematic variations based on country of birth and severity of
  positive symptoms. In subsequent NLP analysis, ASR transcripts showed
  significantly higher GloVe semantic similarity and fewer sentences than manual
  transcripts as well as weaker correlations between NLP metrics and symptom
  scores. We considered the potential impact of these differences in three
  real-world use cases of ASR: electronic health records, voice chatbots, and
  clinical decision support systems. Overall, we argue that assessing ASR
  performance requires looking beyond WER alone. In clinical settings, the
  potential impact of an ASR error is not only influenced by its rate but by its
  type, meaning and context. Our approach provides guidance on how to evaluate
  ASR in clinical research, offering guidance for future researchers and
  developers on key considerations for its implementation."
