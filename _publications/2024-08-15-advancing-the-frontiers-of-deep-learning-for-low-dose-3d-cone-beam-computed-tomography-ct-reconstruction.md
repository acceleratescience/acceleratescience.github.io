title: Advancing the frontiers of deep learning for low-dose 3D cone-beam
  computed tomography (CT) reconstruction
abstract: Image reconstruction from the X-ray attenuation measurement in
  computed tomography (CT) can be formulated as an inverse problem for
  recovering a function in the 3D space from its line integrals. In this work
  the authors propose and evaluate a 3D CBCT reconstruction challenge for
  machine learning methods.
