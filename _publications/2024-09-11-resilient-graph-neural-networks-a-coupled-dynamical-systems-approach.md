title: "Resilient Graph Neural Networks: A Coupled Dynamical Systems Approach"
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have established themselves as a key
  component in addressing diverse graph-based tasks. Despite their notable
  successes, GNNs remain susceptible to input perturbations in the form of
  adversarial attacks. This paper introduces an innovative approach to fortify
  GNNs against adversarial perturbations through the lens of coupled dynamical
  systems. A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is the simultaneous
  learned evolution of both the node features and the adjacency matrix, yielding
  an intrinsic enhancement of model robustness to perturbations in the input
  features and the connectivity of the graph.
