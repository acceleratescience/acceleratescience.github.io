title: "From AGI to ASI: Mapping the Societal and Systemic Impact of
  Superintelligence"
abstract: >-
  

  This paper explores the implications of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its potential transition to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) across multiple societal domains including economics, law, health, education, and consciousness. Framing AGI and superintelligence as a systemic force, we analyse domain-specific disruptions and emergent systemic risks, arguing for an interdisciplinary approach to governance. We also outline some potential impacts of the systemic risk (and benefits) of superintelligence for developing nations. Lastly, we develop some dynamical systems models for understanding the systemic impact of AI. These illustrate cascading failures and feedback loops within fragile socio-technical systems. We call for interdisciplinary approaches to managing the systemic transitions driven by advanced machine intelligence.
