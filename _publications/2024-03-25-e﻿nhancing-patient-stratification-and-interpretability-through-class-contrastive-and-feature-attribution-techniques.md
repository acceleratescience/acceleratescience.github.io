title: E﻿nhancing Patient Stratification and Interpretability Through
  Class-Contrastive and Feature Attribution Techniques
abstract: "A crucial component of the treatment of genetic disorders is
  identifying and characterising the genes and gene modules that drive disease
  processes. Recent advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) improve the
  prospects for achieving this goal. However, many machine learning techniques
  are not explainable and fail to account for gene correlations. In this work,
  we develop a comprehensive set of explainable machine learning techniques to
  perform patient stratification for inflammatory bowel disease. We focus on
  Crohn’s disease (CD) and its subtypes: CD with deep ulcer, CD without deep
  ulcer and IBD-controls. We produce an interpretable probabilistic model over
  disease subtypes using Gaussian Mixture Modelling. We then apply
  class-contrastive and feature-attribution techniques to identify potential
  target genes and modules. We modify the widely used kernelSHAP (Shapley
  Additive Explanations) algorithm to account for gene correlations. We obtain
  relevant gene modules for each disease subtype. We develop a class-contrastive
  technique to visually explain why a particular patient is predicted to have a
  particular subtype of the disease. We show that our results are relevant to
  the disease through Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and a review of the
  literature. We also uncover some novel findings, including currently
  uncharacterised genes. These approaches maybe beneficial, in personalised
  medicine, to inform decision-making regarding the diagnosis and treatment of
  genetic disorders. Our approach is model-agnostic and can potentially be
  applied to other diseases and domains where explainability and feature
  correlations are important."
