title: Ranking the Information Content of Distance Measures
abstract: |
  Real-world data typically contain a large number of features that
  are often heterogeneous in nature, relevance, and also units of
  measure. When assessing the similarity between data points, one can
  build various distance measures using subsets of these
  features. Using the fewest features but still retaining sufficient
  information about the system is crucial in many statistical learning
  approaches, particularly when data are sparse. We introduce a
  statistical test that can assess the relative information retained
  when using two different distance measures, and determine if they
  are equivalent, independent, or if one is more informative than the
  other. This in turn allows finding the most informative distance
  measure out of a pool of candidates. The approach is applied to find
  the most relevant policy variables for controlling the Covid-19
  epidemic and to find compact yet informative representations of
  atomic structures, but its potential applications are wide ranging
  in many branches of science.
description: Researchers can assess the similarity of different data points by
  creating measures of distance between them. This paper assesses the amount of
  information contained in different distance measures.
