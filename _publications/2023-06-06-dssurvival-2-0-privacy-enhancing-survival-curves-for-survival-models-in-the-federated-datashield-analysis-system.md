title: "dsSurvival 2.0: privacy enhancing survival curves for survival models in
  the federated DataSHIELD analysis system"
abstract: >-
  Objective

  Survival models are used extensively in biomedical sciences, where they allow the investigation of the effect of exposures on health outcomes. It is desirable to use diverse data sets in survival analyses, because this offers increased statistical power and generalisability of results. However, there are often challenges with bringing data together in one location or following an analysis plan and sharing results. DataSHIELD is an analysis platform that helps users to overcome these ethical, governance and process difficulties. It allows users to analyse data remotely, using functions that are built to restrict access to the detailed data items (federated analysis). Previous works have provided survival modelling functionality in DataSHIELD (dsSurvival package), but there is a requirement to provide functions that offer privacy enhancing survival curves that retain useful information.


  Results

  We introduce an enhanced version of the dsSurvival package which offers privacy enhancing survival curves for DataSHIELD. Different methods for enhancing privacy were evaluated for their effectiveness in enhancing privacy while maintaining utility. We demonstrated how our selected method could enhance privacy in different scenarios using real survival data. The details of how DataSHIELD can be used to generate survival curves can be found in the associated tutorial.
