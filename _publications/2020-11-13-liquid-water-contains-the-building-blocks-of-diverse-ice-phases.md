title: Liquid Water Contains the Building Blocks of Diverse Ice Phases
abstract: Water molecules can arrange into a liquid with complex hydrogen-bond
  networks and at least 17 experimentally confirmed ice phases with enormous
  structural diversity. It remains a puzzle how or whether this multitude of
  arrangements in different phases of water are related. Here we investigate the
  structural similarities between liquid water and a comprehensive set of 54 ice
  phases in simulations, by directly comparing their local environments using
  general atomic descriptors, and also by demonstrating that a machine-learning
  potential trained on liquid water alone can predict the densities, lattice
  energies, and vibrational properties of the ices. The finding that the local
  environments characterising the different ice phases are found in water sheds
  light on the phase behavior of water, and rationalizes the transferability of
  water models between different phases.
