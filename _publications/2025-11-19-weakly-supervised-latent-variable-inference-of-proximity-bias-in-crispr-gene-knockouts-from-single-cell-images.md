title: Weakly supervised latent variable inference of proximity bias in crispr
  gene knockouts from single-cell images
abstract: High-throughput screening enables biologists to study cell
  perturbations by gen erating large, high-dimensional datasets, such as gene
  expression profiles and cell microscopy images. Particularly in CRISPR-Cas9
  screens, where gene knockout effects are typically represented using
  perturbation-specific conditional mean em beddings, these representations can
  be distorted by off-target effects in which the knockouts impact not only the
  target gene but also neighboring genes on the same chromosomearm, introducing
  “proximity bias”. To address this, we develop a dis crete latent variable
  inference method that leverages correlations between neigh boring
  perturbations as a weak supervision signal to detect single cells affected by
  off-target effects. Removing these cells reduces spurious correlations between
  adjacent gene embeddings, achieving comparable correction performance without
  relying on additional gene expression data. Moreover, we show that the
  identified cells exhibit chromosome-arm specificity, reinforcing the validity
  of our approach and its potential for scaling into a genome-wide proximity
