title: Predicting ruthenium catalysed hydrogenation of esters using machine learning
abstract: Catalytic hydrogenation of esters is a sustainable approach for the
  production of fine chemicals, and pharmaceutical drugs. However, the
  efficiency and cost of catalysts are often bottlenecks in the
  commercialization of such technologies. This paper explores the approach of
  machine learning to predict outcomes of catalytic hydrogenation of esters
  using various ML architectures
