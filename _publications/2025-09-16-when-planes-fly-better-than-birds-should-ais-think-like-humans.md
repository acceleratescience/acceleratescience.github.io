title: "When Planes Fly Better than Birds: Should AIs Think like Humans?"
abstract: "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems continue to outperform humans
  in an increasing range of specialised tasks, a fundamental question emerges at
  the intersection of philosophy, cognitive science, and engineering: should we
  aim to build AIs that think like humans, or should we embrace non-human-like
  architectures that may be more efficient or powerful, even if they diverge
  radically from biological intelligence? This paper draws on a compelling
  analogy from the history of aviation: the fact that aeroplanes, while inspired
  by birds, do not fly like birds. Instead of flapping wings or mimicking avian
  anatomy, engineers developed fixed-wing aircraft governed by aerodynamic
  principles that enabled superior performance. This decoupling of function from
  the biological form invites us to ask whether intelligence, like flight, can
  be achieved without replicating the mechanisms of the human brain. We explore
  this analogy through three main lenses. First, we consider the philosophical
  implications: What does it mean for an entity to be intelligent if it does not
  share our cognitive processes? Can we meaningfully compare different forms of
  intelligence across radically different substrates? Second, we examine
  engineering trade-offs in building AIs modelled on human cognition (e.g.,
  through neural–symbolic systems or cognitive architectures) versus those
  designed for performance alone (e.g., deep learning models). Finally, we
  explore the ethical consequences of diverging from human-like thinking in AI
  systems. If AIs do not think like us, how can we ensure alignment,
  predictability, and shared moral frameworks? By critically evaluating these
  questions, this paper advocates for a pragmatic and pluralistic approach to AI
  design: one that values human-like understanding where it is useful (e.g., for
  interpretability or human–AI interaction) but also recognises the potential of
  novel architectures unconstrained by biological precedent. Intelligence may
  ultimately be a broader concept than the human example suggests, and embracing
  this plurality may be key to building robust and beneficial AI systems."
