title: On The Temporal Domain of Differential Equation Inspired Graph Neural Networks
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in
  modeling complex relationships in graph-structured data. A recent innovation
  in this field is the family of Differential Equation-Inspired Graph Neural
  Networks (DE-GNNs), which leverage principles from continuous dynamical
  systems to model information flow on graphs with built-in properties such as
  feature smoothing or preservation. However, existing DE-GNNs rely on first or
  second-order temporal dependencies. In this paper, the authors propose a
  neural extension to those pre-defined temporal dependencies through a new
  model,  TDE-GNN, which can capture a wide range of temporal dynamics that go
  beyond typical first or second-order methods, and provide use cases where
  existing temporal models are challenged.
