title: cymyc -- Calabi-Yau Metrics, Yukawas, and Curvature
abstract: The authors introduce a high-performance Python library written in Jax
  for numerical investigation of the geometry of a large class of Calabi-Yau
  manifolds and their associated moduli spaces. The authors develop a
  well-defined geometric ansatz to numerically model tensor fields of arbitrary
  degree, considered as sections of the tensor bundle, on this class of
  Calabi--Yau manifolds. This library includes a machine learning component
  which incorporates this ansatz to compute tensor fields of interest on these
  spaces by finding an approximate solution to the system of partial
  differential equations they should satisfy.
