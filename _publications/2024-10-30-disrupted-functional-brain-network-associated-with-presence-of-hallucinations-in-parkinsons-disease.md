title: Disrupted functional brain network associated with presence of
  hallucinations in Parkinsons Disease
abstract: Background Hallucinations negatively impact quality of life in
  Parkinsons disease, yet their neural mechanisms remain poorly understood,
  particularly in early disease stages. This study aimed to identify functional
  connectivity differences associated with visual hallucinations in early
  Parkinsons Disease and to validate these findings across independent datasets.
  Resting state fMRI data from two prior independent studies was used. Group
  differences in functional connectivity were assessed within predefined
  cytoarchitectonic cortical classes and functional networks, followed by
  whole-brain analysis using Network-Based Statistics (NBS). Associations with
  clinical measures, including hallucination severity, motor symptoms,
  cognition, and attention, were also evaluated. The identified functional
  subnetwork shows promise as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for
  Parkinsons disease psychosis, warranting further investigation and validation
  in future studies.
