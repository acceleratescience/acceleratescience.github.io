title: Scalable Amortized GPLVMs for Single Cell Transcriptomics Data
abstract: Dimensionality reduction is crucial for analyzing large-scale
  single-cell RNA-seq data. Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs)
  offer an interpretable dimensionality reduction method, but current scalable
  models lack effectiveness in clustering cell types. The authors introduce an
  improved model, the amortized stochastic variational Bayesian GPLVM (BGPLVM),
  tailored for single-cell RNA-seq with specialized encoder, kernel, and
  likelihood designs. This model matches the performance of the leading
  single-cell variational inference (scVI) approach on synthetic and real-world
  COVID datasets and effectively incorporates cell-cycle and batch information
  to reveal more interpretable latent structures as demonstrated on an innate
  immunity dataset.
