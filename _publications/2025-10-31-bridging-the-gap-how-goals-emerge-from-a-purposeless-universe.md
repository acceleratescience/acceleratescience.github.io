title: "Bridging the Gap: How Goals Emerge from a Purposeless Universe"
abstract: "There is an enduring puzzle: fundamental physics describes dynamics
  without ends, yet biology and cognition teem with goal-directed talk. This
  paper surveys conceptual resources from nonequilibrium thermodynamics,
  autopoiesis, teleonomy, control theory, and evolutionary biology, and proposes
  a synthesis: goals are emergent, graded organisational phenomena arising when
  far-from-equilibrium systems acquire reliable, history-dependent information
  about their environment and couple that information to control architectures
  that maintain their own viability. I propose operational markers for goal-like
  organisation, sketch causal pathways from chemistry to agency, and discuss
  implications for origin-of-life research, cognitive science, and normative
  discourse."
