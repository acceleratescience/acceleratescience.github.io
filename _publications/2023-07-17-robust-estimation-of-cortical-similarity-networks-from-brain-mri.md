title: Robust estimation of cortical similarity networks from brain MRI
abstract: Structural similarity is a growing focus for magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) of connectomes. Here we propose Morphometric INverse Divergence
  (MIND), a new method to estimate within-subject similarity between cortical
  areas based on the divergence between their multivariate distributions of
  multiple MRI features. Compared to the prior approach of morphometric
  similarity networks (MSNs) on *n* > 11,000 scans spanning three human datasets
  and one macaque dataset, MIND networks were more reliable, more consistent
  with cortical cytoarchitectonics and symmetry and more correlated with
  tract-tracing measures of axonal connectivity. MIND networks derived from
  human T1-weighted MRI were more sensitive to age-related changes than MSNs or
  networks derived by tractography of diffusion-weighted MRI. Gene co-expression
  between cortical areas was more strongly coupled to MIND networks than to MSNs
  or tractography. MIND network phenotypes were also more heritable, especially
  edges between structurally differentiated areas. MIND network analysis
  provides a biologically validated lens for cortical connectomics using readily
  available MRI data.
