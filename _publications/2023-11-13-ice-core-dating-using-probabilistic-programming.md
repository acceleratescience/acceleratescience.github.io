title: Ice Core Dating using Probabilistic Programming
abstract: In this paper, the team present an exploration of the use of
  probabilistic models for automatic dating of ice cores, using probabilistic
  programming to showcase its use for prototyping, automatic inference and
  maintainability, and demonstrate common failure modes of these tools.
