title: "Framework conditions and funding for AI in science Mutual learning
  exercise on national policies for AI in science : first thematic report"
abstract: The Mutual Learning Exercise (MLE) on National Policies for Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) in Science provides a forum for Member States and Associated
  Countries of Horizon Europe to share operational and policy approaches to
  advance the adoption of AI in science. Building on previous discussions about
  infrastructure and talent, this report focuses on funding and framework
  conditions for AI in science. Drawing from discussions at the MLE workshop in
  Belgium on 20-21 March 2025, a survey of national policymakers, and desk-based
  research, this report explores funding, governance, and institutional support
  models for AI in science from across Europe. It identifies different types of
  funding frameworks and considers what lessons successful AI in science
  initiatives offer for the design of funding interventions. It then considers
  the research governance challenges emerging from AI adoption in science. It
  concludes by reviewing the diverse policy levers that play a role in enabling
  AI in science. Across these areas, the report proposes recommendations to
  support AI adoption in science. Thanks are due to the participants in these
  evidence-collection activities for sharing insights to inform this document.
