title: "The GeometricKernels Package: Heat and Mat\\'ern Kernels for Geometric
  Learning on Manifolds, Meshes, and Graphs"
abstract: Kernels are a fundamental technical primitive in machine learning. In
  recent years, kernel-based methods such as Gaussian processes are becoming
  increasingly important in applications where quantifying uncertainty is of key
  interest. In settings that involve structured data defined on graphs, meshes,
  manifolds, or other related spaces, defining kernels with good
  uncertainty-quantification behavior, and computing their value numerically, is
  less straightforward than in the Euclidean setting. To address this
  difficulty, the authors present GeometricKernels, a software package which
  implements the geometric analogs of classical Euclidean squared exponential -
  also known as heat - and Mat'ern kernels, which are widely-used in settings
  where uncertainty is of key interest. As a byproduct, the authors obtain the
  ability to compute Fourier-feature-type expansions, which are widely used in
  their own right, on a wide set of geometric spaces
