title: Molecular and micro-architectural mapping of gray matter alterations in
  psychosis
abstract: This paper explores structural magnetic resonance imaging data from
  38,696 healthy controls and 1256 psychosis-related conditions. Using a
  normative modeling approach, the authors generated centile scores for cortical
  gray matter (GM) phenotypes, identifying deviations in regional volumes below
  the expected trajectory for all conditions, with a greater impact on the
  clinically diagnosed ones, FEP and chronic. Additionally, 46 neurobiological
  features from healthy individuals were mapped to these abnormal centiles using
  a multivariate approach. Results revealed that neurobiological features were
  highly co-localized with centile deviations, where metabolism, cerebral blood
  flow and neurotransmitter concentrations showed the most consistent spatial
  overlap with abnormal GM trajectories. Taken together these findings shed
  light on the vulnerability factors that may underlie atypical brain maturation
  during different stages of psychosis.
