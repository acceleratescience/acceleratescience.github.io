title: Dimensionality Reduction as Probabilistic Inference
abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithms compress high-dimensional
  data into a lower dimensional representation while preserving important
  features of the data. DR is a critical step in many analysis pipelines as it
  enables visualisation, noise reduction and efficient downstream processing of
  the data. In this paper, the team introduce the ProbDR variational framework,
  which interprets a wide range of classical DR algorithms as probabilistic
  inference algorithms.
