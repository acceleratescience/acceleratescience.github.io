title: "Linear combinations of Gaussian latents in generative models:
  interpolation and beyond"
abstract: Sampling from generative models has become a crucial tool for
  applications like data synthesis and augmentation. Diffusion, Flow Matching
  and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various
  modalities, and rely on Gaussian latent variables for generation. For
  search-based or creative applications that require additional control over the
  generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable
  directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g.
  interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in
  special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Combination
  of Gaussian variables (COG) as a general purpose method to form linear
  combinations of latent variables while adhering to the assumptions of the
  generative model. COG is easy to implement yet outperforms recent
  sophisticated methods for interpolation. As COG naturally addresses the
  broader task of forming linear combinations, new capabilities are afforded,
  including the construction of subspaces of the latent space, dramatically
  simplifying the creation of expressive low-dimensional spaces of
  high-dimensional objects.
