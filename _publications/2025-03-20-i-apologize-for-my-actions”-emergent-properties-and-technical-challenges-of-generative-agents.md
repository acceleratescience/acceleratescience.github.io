title: "I apologize for my actions”: Emergent Properties  and Technical
  Challenges of Generative Agents"
abstract: This work explores the design, implementation, and usage of generative
  agents towards simulating human behaviour. Through simulating (mis)information
  spread, we investigate the emergent social behaviours they produce. Generative
  agents demonstrate robustness to (mis)information spread, showing realistic
  conversational patterns. However, this robustness limits agents’ abilities to
  realistically simulate human like information dissemination. Generative agents
  also exhibit novel and realistic emergent social behaviours, such as
  deception, confrontation, and internalized regret. Using deception, agents
  avoid certain conversations. Through confrontation, an agent can verify
  information or even apologize for their actions. Lastly, internalized regret
  displays direct evidence that agents can internalize their experiences and act
  on them in a human-like way, such as through expressing remorse for their
  actions. We also identify significant technical dynamics and other phenomena.
  Generative agents are vulnerable to produce unre alistic hallucinations, but
  can also produce confabulations which f ill in logical gaps and
  discontinuities to improve realism. We also identify the novel dynamics of
  “contextual eavesdropping” and “behavioural poisoning”. Via contextual
  eavesdropping and behavioural poisoning, agent behaviour is altered through
  infor mation leakage and sensitivity to certain statements, respectively.
