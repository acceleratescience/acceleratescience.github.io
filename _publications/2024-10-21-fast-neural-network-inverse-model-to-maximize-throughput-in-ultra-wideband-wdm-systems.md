title: Fast neural network inverse model to maximize throughput in
  ultra-wideband WDM systems
abstract: Ultra-wideband systems expand the optical bandwidth in
  wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) systems to provide increased capacity
  using the existing fiber infrastructure. In this paper, the authors propose a
  fast and accurate data-driven deep neural network-based physical layer in this
  paper which can achieve 99 â€“ 100% throughput compared to the semi-analytical
  approach with more than 2 orders of magnitude improvement in computational
  time.
