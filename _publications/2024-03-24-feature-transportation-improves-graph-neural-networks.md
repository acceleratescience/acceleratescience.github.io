title: Feature transportation improves graph neural networks
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning
  representations for graph-structured data. However, GNNs still face challenges
  in modeling complex phenomena that involve feature transportation. In this
  paper, the authors propose a novel GNN architecture inspired by
  Advection-Diffusion-Reaction systems, called ADR-GNN and show that it improves
  or offers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art networks.
