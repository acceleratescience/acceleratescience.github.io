title: "DiGRAF: Diffeomorphic Graph-Adaptive Activation Function"
abstract: In this paper, the authors propose a novel activation function
  tailored specifically for graph data in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), DiGRAF,
  leveraging Continuous Piecewise-Affine Based (CPAB) transformation. In
  addition to its graph-adaptivity and flexibility, DiGRAF also possesses
  properties that are widely recognized as desirable for activation functions,
  such as differentiability, boundness within the domain, and computational
  efficiency. The authors conduct an extensive set of experiments across diverse
  datasets and tasks, demonstrating a consistent and superior performance of
  DiGRAF compared to traditional and graph-specific activation functions,
  highlighting its effectiveness as an activation function for GNNs
