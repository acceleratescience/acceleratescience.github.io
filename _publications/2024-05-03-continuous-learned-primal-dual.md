title: Continuous Learned Primal Dual
abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) propose the idea
  that a sequence of layers in a neural network is just a discretisation of an
  ODE, and thus can instead be directly modelled by a parameterised ODE. The
  authors propose an upgrade to the well known primal dual method for
  reconstruction, using the literature of neural ODEs, to interpret the network
  as solving an ODE rather than a set of discrete steps.
