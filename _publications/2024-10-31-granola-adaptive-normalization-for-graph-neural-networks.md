title: "GRANOLA: Adaptive Normalization for Graph Neural Networks"
abstract: Despite their widespread adoption, the incorporation of off-the-shelf
  normalization layers within a GNN architecture may not effectively capture the
  unique characteristics of graph-structured data, potentially reducing the
  expressive power of the overall architecture. The authors propose GRANOLA, a
  novel graph-adaptive normalization layer. Unlike existing normalization
  layers, GRANOLA normalizes node features by adapting to the specific
  characteristics of the graph, particularly by generating expressive
  representations of its neighborhood structure, obtained by leveraging the
  propagation of Random Node Features (RNF) in the graph. Extensive empirical
  evaluation of various graph benchmarks underscores the superior performance of
  GRANOLA over existing normalization techniques.
