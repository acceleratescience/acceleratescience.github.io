title: Precision String Phenomenology
abstract: In order to make physical predictions, we require certain geometric
  data on a given Calabi-Yau manifold. This is recovered by considering the
  system of partial differential equations which a given geometric object should
  satisfy, subsequently solved using a neural network ansatz. Function
  optimisation on general manifolds is highly nontrivial - any sensible model
  must obey a set of geometric constraints imposed by the topology of the
  manifold. The authors demonstrate, standard neural network solvers have
  difficulty adhering to these conditions tabula rasa, resulting in nonphysical
  predictions. The authors a very general ansatz, valid for any Calabi-Yau
  manifold, which respects these conditions by construction, and allows the
  modelling of tensor fields on Calabi-Yau manifold of arbitrary degree. These
  novel methods agree with independent numerical computations and leave the
  authors well-poised to generalise this program to a wider class of models.
