      <h3>July Data Science for Science Residency - Applications Open</h3>
      <p>
<strong>Applications for this round of the Residency are now closed. To be notified about future courses, please email accelerate-science@cst.cam.ac.uk and ask to be added to our mailing list<strong> 
        
       PhD students and postdocs across Cambridge have another chance to apply for a funded training course that is successfully equipping scientists with powerful tools to progress their research.  The next Data for Science Residency will run for five weeks from Monday 19 July 2021. Applications are open until 21 May 2021.
<br />
<br />
<strong>What does the course cover?</strong>
<br />
<br />
        The course aims to give researchers in fields outside computer science the skills they need to use machine learning (ML) in their research and helps them apply data analysis to their own datasets and problems. On the course, you will: use data science techniques on your own datasets and problem; collaborate on real-world data science challenges in teams as part of two hackathons; and contribute to a world-leading community of scientists and researchers. You can read more about how once of our recent participants has used the course to advance her work <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/july-data-science-residency-applications-open">here</a>.
<br />
<br />
Residents will cover 6 modules over a period of 5 weeks:
<ul>
<li> Introduction to Python (preparatory module)</li>
<li> Data Processing with Pandas</li>
<li> Data Visualisation</li>
<li> Web Scraping, JSON and APIs</li>
<li> Introduction to machine learning</li>
<li> Hackathon & presentation</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>What are the entry requirements?</strong>
<br />
<br />  
Participants should be current PhD students or researchers at the University of Cambridge and have basic programming skills (e.g. the ability to use Excel, MATLAB, R or Python). Participants should be available from 19th July to 20th August and can expect to spend 30 hours on the programme each week, including timetabled sessions and periods of independent study.     
<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the entry requirements?</strong>
<br />
<br />        
Candidates should complete <a href="https://forms.gle/wTiDWZcF7pZarqWz5">this application form</a> by 9:00 am on 21 May. After completing the application form, candidates will be asked to complete a short programming exercise, which is intended to give a sense of their current programming abilities. This exercise will take approximately three hours to complete, and the deadline for completion will be 9:00 am on 1 June. Further details will be emailed to candidates on 21 May.
<br />
<br />
Candidates should ensure their supervisors or managers are content for them to join the course before applying and should be prepared to commit to participating in course activities between 19 July and 20 August.
<br />
