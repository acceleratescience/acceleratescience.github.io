      <h3>March 2022 Data Science for Science Residency - Applications Open</h3>
      <p>
<p><strong>PhD students and postdocs across Cambridge University can apply for this funded training course, which will equip them will skills in data science for science.</strong> </p>
        
       We are offering PhDs and postdocs from across Cambridge University a funded 'Data Science for Science' training course. Aimed at helping participants apply data science tools to their own datasets and research problems, the course runs over five weeks, starting on 7 March 2022. Previous courses have attracted participants from fields including chemistry, biochemistry, physics, engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine and psychology. Applications for the next course are open until 9am on 24 January 2022.
<br />
<br />
<strong>What does the course cover?</strong>
<br />
<br />
        The course aims to give researchers in fields outside computer science the skills they need to use machine learning (ML) in their research, and help them apply data analysis to their own datasets and problems. On the course, you will: use data science techniques on your own datasets and research questions; collaborate on real-world data science challenges in teams as part of two hackathons; and contribute to a world-leading community of scientists and researchers. You can read more about how once of our recent participants has used the course to advance her work <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/july-data-science-residency-applications-open">here</a>.
<br />
<br />
Residents will cover 6 modules over a period of 5 weeks:
<ul>
<li> Introduction to Python (preparatory module)</li>
<li> Data Processing with Pandas</li>
<li> Data Visualisation</li>
<li> Web Scraping, JSON and APIs</li>
<li> Introduction to machine learning</li>
<li> Project & presentation</li>
</ul>
<strong>What are the entry requirements?</strong>
<br />
<br />  
Participants should be current PhD students or researchers at the University of Cambridge and have basic programming skills (e.g. the ability to use Excel, MATLAB, R or Python). Participants should be available from 7 March to 8 April 2022 and can expect to spend 30 hours on the programme each week, including timetabled sessions and periods of independent study.     
<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the entry requirements?</strong>
<br />
<br />        
Candidates should complete <a href="https://forms.gle/wTiDWZcF7pZarqWz5">this application form</a> by 9:00 am on 24 January. After completing the application form, candidates will be asked to complete a short programming exercise, which is intended to give a sense of their current programming abilities. This exercise will take approximately three hours to complete. Further details will be emailed to candidates on 24 January, and you will have approx. 1 week to complete the exercise.
<br />
<br />
Candidates should ensure their supervisors or managers are content for them to join the course before applying and should be prepared to commit to participating in course activities between 7 March and 8 April.
<br />
<br />
