title: "Machine Learning for Science: Mathematics at the Interface of
  Data-driven and Mechanistic Modelling"
excerpt: "From 11 - 16 June 2023, 40 participants with expertise in applications
  of machine learning in the sciences took part in the workshop Machine Learning
  for Science: Mathematics at the Interface of Data-driven and Mechanistic
  Modelling, co-organised by Neil Lawrence and Jessica Montgomery, from the
  Accelerate Programme and Bernhard Schölkopf (University of Tübingen). It set
  out to consider how mathematical innovations can help produce machine learning
  tools that can be deployed in support of scientific discovery, creating new
  interfaces between physical and data-driven modelling approaches. "

From 11 - 16 June 2023, 40 participants with expertise in applications of machine learning in the sciences took part in the workshop Machine Learning for Science: Mathematics at the Interface of Data-driven and Mechanistic Modelling, co-organised by [Neil Lawrence](https://acceleratescience.github.io/team/neil-d-lawrence.html) and [Jessica Montgomery](https://acceleratescience.github.io/team/jessica-montgomery.html), from the Accelerate Programme and Bernhard Schölkopf (University of Tübingen). It set out to consider how mathematical innovations can help produce machine learning tools that can be deployed in support of scientific discovery, creating new interfaces between physical and data-driven modelling approaches. 


In support of this objective, the workshop convened three discussion themes - Lessons from the application of machine learning in science; Foundational concepts and emerging methods; Machine learning for Earth and climate science.


A report summarising discussions and insights from the workshop can be accessed [here](https://publications.mfo.de/bitstream/handle/mfo/4057/OWR_2023_26.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).


An interactive graphic summary of the talks is available [here](https://acceleratescience.github.io/assets/uploads/oberwolfach-graphics-ipdf.pdf).
