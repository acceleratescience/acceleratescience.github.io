      <h3>Machine learning for scientific discovery: PhD studentships from Accelerate Science</h3>
      <p>
<strong>The Accelerate Programme is offering 3-year studentships for candidates applying to the PhD in Computer Science at Cambridge, starting in autumn 2022.</strong>
<br />
<br />
        The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery is a high-profile Cambridge University initiative promoting the use of machine learning to tackle major scientific challenges. The Programme is building a community of committed researchers working at the interface of machine learning and different scientific domains, with the aim of accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.  
<br />
<br />
We are inviting applications for funding from the Programme to support students studying for the PhD in Computer Science at Cambridge, joining in October 2022. Funding from Accelerate is available to support three years of study, covering course fees (at either international or national rates) and a stipend. Successful applicants will develop a project at the intersection of machine learning and a scientific discipline, pursuing research that contributes to both the advancement of that discipline and progress in machine learning. 
<br />
<br />
Current areas of interest for the Programme include the use machine learning to advance research relating to:
<ul>
  <li>Applied mathematics and theoretical physics: how can we use machine learning to better understand complex geometries and create new understandings of space-time or quantum gravity?</li>
  <li>Genomics and computational biology: how can machine learning-enabled advances in genomics help us better understand the building blocks of living systems (and how they contribute to individual health and wellbeing)? </li>
  <li>Psychiatry: how can researchers and clinicians use machine learning tools to better understand and predict mental health conditions?</li>
</ul>
Applicants are invited to propose topics that would advance research in one of these themes or that bridge these areas of research. In developing project ideas, applicants may wish to seek inspiration from the work of research leaders connected to the Programme:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://b2du.github.io">Bianca Dumitrascu</a>, Accelerate Science Research Fellow, Department of Computer Science and Technology 
  <li><a href="https://oatml.cs.ox.ac.uk/members/challenger_mishra/">Challenger Mishra</a>, Accelerate Science Research Fellow, Department of Computer Science and Technology 
  <li><a href="https://semorgan.org">Sarah Morgan</a>, Accelerate Science Research Fellow, Department of Computer Science and Technology 
  <li><a href="http://carlhenrik.com">Carl-Henrik Ek</a>, Senior Lecturer in Machine Learning, Department of Computer Science and Technology
</ul>
The successful candidate will have:
<ul>
  <li>a strong interest in working at the interface of machine learning and the sciences; 
  <li>excellent oral and written communication skills; 
  <li>good team-working skills, ideally with experience of working in interdisciplinary teams; and 
  <li>strong motivation for their proposed project. 
</ul>
Applicants will be expected to have a 1st or strong 2.1 degree in a related subject and hold (or be studying for) a master’s degree in a relevant specialist area. To be eligible for the studentship, candidates will be expected to have applied for the PhD in Computer Science for Michaelmas 2022 admission. Applicants are encouraged to make informal contact with potential supervisors prior to making an application. 
<br />
<br />
To apply for the Accelerate studentship, candidates should complete the application form <a href="https://cambridge.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bvElaayV17JaKVM">at this link</a>. This form seeks information about your skills, experiences, and motivations for joining the Accelerate team. It also requires you to submit your research proposal, CV, and references.
<br />
<br />
Applications close at midnight on 3 December 2021. To be considered for the studentship, candidates must also have applied for the PhD in Computer Science at Cambridge University. This is a separate application process. Please consult the <a href="https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/how-do-i-apply">University Graduate Admissions website</a> for details of the University admissions process. Admissions to the graduate program and competition for the studentship will be considered separately. The research proposal, CV and references submitted in application for the Accelerate studentship should be the same documents as submitted for your application to the PhD in Computer Science.
<br />
<br />
For advice about potential supervisors and the application process, including advice on which department to apply to, please contact the programme coordinator at accelerate-science@cst.cam.ac.uk

<strong>FAQs</strong>
<br />
<br />
<b>What does the Accelerate studentship offer?</b>
<br />
The Accelerate program values multi-disciplinary approaches to modern scientific challenges. As such, the studentships will afford the opportunity to establish new cross-disciplinary collaborations  involving researchers in other departments and institutions. To facilitate this, the PhD candidates will have the opportunity to audit courses offered in associated departments, and will have the option to be mentored by a researcher in another department. The candidates may be provided with a desk space in an associated department subject to availability of space and funds.

Funding from Accelerate is available to support three years of study, covering course fees (at either international or national rates) and a stipend. To see current funding rates, please use the University’s calculator <a href="https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/finance">at this link</a>.
<br />
<br />
<b>What information do I need to submit in my application?</b>
<br />
The form <a href="https://cambridge.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bvElaayV17JaKVM">at this link</a> asks for basic contact details, some information about your motivations for joining Accelerate, a research proposal and your CV. The research proposal, CV and references should be the same documents as you have submitted in your application for the PhD in Computer Science.
<br />
<br />
<b>When do interviews for the Accelerate Programme take place?</b>
<br />
Interviews and candidate selection will take place in early January. 
<br />
<br />
<b>What happens next?</b>
<br />
We will be reviewing applications in December, and inviting a shortlist of candidates to interview in January. In parallel, your application will also be being considered for the PhD Computer Science.
