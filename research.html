    title: Predicting  phase behaviors of superionic water at planetary conditions
    authors: Cheng, B., Bethkenhagen, M., Pickard, C.J. and Hamel, S. Predicting  phase behaviors of superionic water at planetary conditions. arxiv (2021)
    link_to: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09035
    class: machine-learning
    desc: Understanding the thermodynamic and transport properties of water is crucial for planetary science. This paper uses machine learning to characterise the phase behaviours of water at extreme conditions.

    title: Assessing psychosis risk using quantitative markers of disorganised speech
    authors: Morgan, S.E., Diederen, K., Vértes, P.E. et al. Assessing psychosis risk using quantitative markers of disorganised speech. medRxiv (2021)
    link_to: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.20248717
    class: machine-learning
    desc: Disorganised speech can help predict later psychotic illness. This paper assesses the performance of twelve automated Natural Language Processing markers in differentiating transcribed speech excerpts from subjects at clinical high risk for psychosis, first episode psychosis patients and healthy control subjects.

    title: Understanding the behaviour of water
    authors: Monserrat, B., Brandenburg, J.G., Engel, E.A. et al. Liquid water contains the building blocks of diverse ice phases. Nat Commun 11, 5757 (2020). 
    link_to: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19606-y 
    class: machine-learning
    desc: This paper investigates the structural similarities between liquid water and a comprehensive set of 54 simulated ice phases. Its findings shed light on the phase behaviour of water.

    title: Predicting the phase diagram of water
    authors: Reinhardt, A., Cheng, B. Quantum-mechanical exploration of the phase diagram of water. Nat Commun 12, 588 (2021). 
    link_to: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20821-w 
    class: machine-learning
    desc: This paper analyses the phase diagram of water at three hybrid density-functional-theory levels of approximation. It demonstrates that it is possible to predict the phase diagram of a polymorphic system from first principles and provides a thermodynamic way of testing the limits of quantum-mechanical calculations.

    title: Optimising marker gene selection
    authors: Dumitrascu, B., Villar, S., Mixon, D.G. et al. Optimal marker gene selection for cell type discrimination in single cell analyses. Nat Commun 12, 1186 (2021). 
    link_to: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21453-4 
    class: machine-learning
    desc: This paper presents scGeneFit, an approach for marker selection in single cell RNA-seq. This method selects gene markers that jointly optimize cell label recovery using label-aware compressive classification methods.
