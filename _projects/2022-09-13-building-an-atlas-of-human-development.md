### The Human Cell Atlas programme aims to chart the properties of human cells, building a reference map of the human body that can be used to understand human health and to treat disease. 

Contributing to this work, led by Professor Neil Lawrence, this Human Cell Atlas project is creating a detailed single-cell and spatial atlas of embryos in late organogenesis. Its aim is to build an in-silico atlas of the human embryo. Its approach is to deploy machine learning approaches to large-scale dimensionality reduction, focusing on latent variable techniques such as GPLVM or variational auto-encoders.
