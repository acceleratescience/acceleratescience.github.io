As AI continues to advance, concerns are growing about its impact on traditional grading systems across the HE sector. AI models are now capable of writing essays and providing detailed feedback that is improving rapidly, raising questions about how universities should adapt to this technology.

OpRaise (opportunities and potential risks of AI in supporting evaluation) aims to transform higher education assessment by establishing an evidence-based framework for integrating AI into academic evaluation processes. To do this, the winning team will systematically analyse a comprehensive corpus of university essays from summative assessments in UK Universities. The team will compare expert academic evaluations against assessments from multiple AI systems, varying prompting strategies to optimise AI performance. By analysing the differences between human and AI assessments the goal is to develop targeted interventions to enhance AI effectiveness.
