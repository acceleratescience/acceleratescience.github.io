We will be holding a funding Q and A event on Wednesday 5 June from 15:00 - 16:00 where we will answer your questions about the funding call and there will be an opportunity to talk to our Machine Learning Engineers about the technical aspects of your project. The session will take place in person at the West Hub (West 1) with no need to register in advance.
