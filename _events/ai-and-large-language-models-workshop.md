Would you like to use Large Language Models (LLMs) in your research work, but need help to get started? 

The Accelerate Programme are planning a one day workshop for researchers interested in using LLMs in their research. The aim of the session will be to equip you with knowledge of how LLMs work and how to implement them so you can use them in your own research. The workshop will share insights from the LLM study group convened by Accelerate last term and will draw together tips for best practice. 

Participants will require some background knowledge for this course. We will be looking at Python code and neural networks so familiarity with Python and some knowledge of machine learning and neural networks is required. We won't be coding during the session, but will share code with you for you to work with after the session. 

Tï»¿he workshop is open to researchers at the University of Cambridge.
