Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence – two terms often used interchangeably - are both rapidly becoming invaluable tools in neuroscience research. But what are they? What is the difference between them? How are they being used in modern brain research and more importantly, would you allow your medical treatment to be altered based on their findings?

Dr Sarah Morgan (Psychiatry/Computer Science & Technology), who is using machine learning approaches, network science and natural language processing to better understand mental health conditions, will contribute to this panel discussion at the Cambridge Festival on 6 April 2022.
