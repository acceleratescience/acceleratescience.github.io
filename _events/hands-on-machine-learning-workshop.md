We know that when you’re learning AI & ML, a mix of classroom theory and hands-on practice is the best way to learn. So, we’re running a 1-day hands-on ML workshop to help you apply the skills you’ve learnt from taking part in the Data Science Residency and ML Academy and develop further practical ML skills.\
\
During this workshop, you’ll work in teams on a real dataset of your choice, with support from Accelerate Scientists and Engineers. You’ll need to work on building, tuning and evaluating ML models for your chosen dataset - we have some dataset ideas to kick you off, or you can bring your own. This is an opportunity to work on real-life ML problems and data, and gain confidence in using tools that you can take back to your own domain and research project.\
\
This workshop is for people who are already confident with both ML fundamentals and Python programming. This isn’t a Python or ML introduction day - you’ll spend most of the day programming! We’ll use open-source libraries including HuggingFace and scikit-learn, so please come with a laptop and be prepared to get coding, before presenting your results to the group at the end of the day. We will be working with Python and so all participants will need to have Python set up on their computer in advance.\
\
The workshop will take place on Monday 25 March at the William Gates Building from 9:30am - 5pm. \
