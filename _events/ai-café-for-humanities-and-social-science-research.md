Are you using AI methods in your research, or considering doing so? Would you like to meet other researchers exploring the challenges and possibilities of deploying AI to answer humanities or social science research questions? Do you need practical advice and guidance on proposal writing, software, hardware, data collection methods, data security, privacy and compliance, selection and deployment of machine models and packages?

If the answer to any of these is yes and you’re a member of the University of Cambridge, please come along to the AI Café organised by Accelerate and CDH Learning Programme on 25 April taking place in room SG1 at the Alison Richard Building. 

There is a growing community of researchers in the arts, humanities and social sciences at Cambridge who are using AI. Join us to find out more about some of the research projects currently using AI to answer research questions and to discuss your ideas with our team.

The session will start with a series of short presentations on projects using AI methods to answer research questions in the humanities and social sciences. Following the presentations, there will be the opportunity to meet other researchers and to discuss your questions about AI with our teams.

**Format:**

**Introduction and project showcase: 12pm – 1pm**

* Introducing Accelerate (Ryan Daniels / Catherine Breslin)
* AI Researcher project lightning talks plus Q and A from:

  * Felix Steffek  (Law)
  * Petre Breazu (Linguistics)
  * R﻿adzim Sendyka (Department of Computer Science and Technology, Assyriology)

**AI Café: 1pm – 2.30pm**

* Join our experts for more informal discussion at café-style tables. We’ll also have tea and coffee available in the foyer. Researchers are welcome to join this as a drop-in and there is no requirement to attend the introduction from 12-1pm beforehand.

*If you’re unable to attend on the day and you’d like some 1-to-1 advice on your AI project from Accelerate, you can also sign up for the Accelerate Machine Learning Engineering Clinic [here](https://acceleratescience.github.io/machine-learning-clinic)*

*To help with arrangements, please sign up via [Eventbrite](https://aicafe.eventbrite.co.uk/) to attend so that we can cater accurately.*
