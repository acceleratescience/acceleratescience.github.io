  As part of the Ai Fringe, Accelerate are working with the Kavli Centre for
  Science, Ethics, and the Public to connect members of the public with
  scientists  in conversation about the implications of AI for the future we all
  share. 


  Join us in our pop-up conversation lab, to meet some of the people working on this technology every day. Do we feel hopeful about the benefits this technology could bring us? Or are there things that feel a bit scary?

  From Alexa, to FitBit, to Netflix and ChatGPT - Artificial Intelligence is already shaping our daily lives. But now is the time to decide together how it should shape our future.


  There are no silly questions in the (cardboard!) lab, just great conversations. And everyone is welcome.


  C﻿ome along to Parker's Piece between 10am - 4pm on Thursday 26 October and Friday 27 October to meet with our researchers on board a double decker bus!
