Are you interested in finding out more about working with Machine Learning in your research? Or are you already deploying Machine Learning but have run into challenges you can’t solve on your own? Machine Learning Engineers from the University’s Accelerate Programme will be available to answer your questions and provide advice at a special Machine Learning Clinic in collaboration with Cambridge Digital Humanities.  

**Where?**
Alison Richard Building Foyer and SG1  

**When?** 
2-4pm on Wednesday 17 May  

**What kind of problems can you help me with?**
We can offer advice related to proposal writing, software, hardware, data collection methods, data security, privacy and compliance, selection and deployment of ML models and packages and many other aspects of deploying Machine Learning in your research. You do not need to be currently working on a project using ML to access the clinic, we are also happy to take enquiries from researchers who are still at an early stage in project development.  We can also help you with suggestions about training courses and self-study resources.  

**How do I book?**
The clinic is running as a drop-in so you’re welcome to just turn up on the day. If you can’t make that time slot or you’d like to share some information in advance, please use the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScT0oQ35JTwTzrgTAAoMqchTFyU_17-QGlEY9ft8Reift_Eaw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to tell us more about your issues. 

*Please note, this form has been tailored to offer support for researchers in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. If you are from another discipline you can also access the Accelerate Programme's general FAQs and ML Clinic log form [here](https://acceleratescience.github.io/machine-learning-clinic)*
