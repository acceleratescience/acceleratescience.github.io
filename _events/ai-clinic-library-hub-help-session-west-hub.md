Have you thought about using AI in your research but aren’t sure how to get started? Or are you already using AI and have run into challenges with implementation? Come and meet the Accelerate Programme’s team of AI experts to find the support you need.

We are holding an AI Clinic Session as part of the  Library Hub Help Sessions on Wednesday 23 October from 10:00 - 13:00 at the West Hub. The clinic is open to all staff and students and offers free expert support implementing AI in your research. No matter your level of experience with AI, we invite you to come and talk to our team. We support projects at all stages - from ideation, grant writing and data gathering, through to software issues and publication. The clinic is running as a drop-in session, but we also have a [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=RQSlSfq9eUut41R7TzmG6SaVOxbmBOdAg9GzbnrB5IRUNDhIUjNCRkI0SjFaV1Y2VDRTR1pPWTNKOS4u) if you’d like to share details of your issue in advance.

*The clinic is open at all times to offer support with AI implementation.
