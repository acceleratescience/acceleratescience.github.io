The Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) are pleased to invite you to an AI café on Monday 20 October from 14:00 - 16:00.

\
Are you using AI methods in your research, or considering doing so? Would you like to find out more about how AI is being used in cancer research and meet other researchers exploring the challenges and possibilities of deploying AI in research?\
\
Come along to the AI café on Monday 20 October to hear short talks from researchers and to discuss your questions about AI with an expert.\
\
T﻿he AI café will take place in CRUK Institute Cambridge, Room 009 and is open to postgraduate students and academic teaching or research staff that are interested in using AI in their research. The event is open to all and we encourage those who are interested in this area but are new to AI and don't have a technical background to attend to find out more about how AI can be used in cancer research.
