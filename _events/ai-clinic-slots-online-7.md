Have you thought about using AI in your research but aren’t sure how to get started? Or are you already using AI and have run into challenges with implementation? Meet the Accelerate Programme’s team of AI experts to find the support you need.

The Accelerate Programme’s AI clinic is designed to help with challenging software issues a scientist encounters in all phases of the research pipeline when utilising machine learning. This includes issues related to: data collection, implementing privacy and compliance controls, data pipelines, model implementation, hardware/GPU matters, deploying models on the cloud, and packaging & publishing models.

We define a challenging software issue as one that is difficult to find online guidance/tutorials on, or basically one that you have attempted to resolve via multiple approaches but had no success in doing so.

No matter your level of experience with AI, we invite you to book a session and talk to our team to see how we can support you to implement AI in your research.

The clinic is open at any time for support so if you want to get in touch before your session or to book an earlier time, please email accelerate-mle@cst.cam.ac.uk.

Bookable slots are available [here.](https://www.training.cam.ac.uk/apsci/event/5598182)
