Have you thought about using AI in your research but aren’t sure how to get started? Or are you already using AI and have run into challenges with implementation? Come and meet the Accelerate team to find the support you need. 

We are holding an in-person AI Clinic Session on Wednesday 13th March from 11am – 1pm in the Todd-Hamied room of the Chemistry Department. The clinic is open to support all staff and students with AI research. No matter your level of experience with AI, we invite you to come and talk to our team. We support projects at all stages - from ideation, grant writing and data gathering, through to software issues and publication. The clinic is running as a drop-in session, but we also have a [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=RQSlSfq9eUut41R7TzmG6SaVOxbmBOdAg9GzbnrB5IRUNDhIUjNCRkI0SjFaV1Y2VDRTR1pPWTNKOS4u) if you'd like to share details of your issue in advance.
