AI agents are moving from “chatbots” to actionable research collaborators that can plan, execute, and iterate on complex workflows: literature mapping, hypothesis generation, data exploration, experiment design, code scaffolding, and report drafting—while keeping you in control.

In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn how modern agentic systems are built (tools, memory, planning, evaluation, guardrails) and how to apply them responsibly across disciplines, from humanities to natural sciences. You’ll get early access to a platform running state-of-the-art multi-agent systems supported by the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery, Google, and the Simons Foundation.

Through guided exercises, you’ll deploy agents on your own research questions, learn patterns that reliably improve output quality, and leave with reusable templates you can apply immediately in your day-to-day research.

Open to all postgraduate students and research staff.

Lunch will be provided with the opportunity for networking during the breaks.
