The Accelerate Programme are planning a one day workshop for researchers at the University of Cambridge interested in using LLMs in their research. The aim of the session will be to equip you with knowledge of how LLMs work and how to implement them so you can use them in your own research. The workshop will share insights from the LLM study group convened by Accelerate and will draw together tips for best practice. 

Participants will require some background knowledge for this course. We will be looking at Python code and neural networks so familiarity with Python and some knowledge of machine learning and neural networks is required. We won't be coding during the session, but will share code with you for you to work with after the session. 

Tï»¿he workshop will take place at the William Gates Building. Please sign up [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=RQSlSfq9eUut41R7TzmG6SaVOxbmBOdAg9GzbnrB5IRUQ0g2OEg3MjQ5SUo0STQ2UlpST1hZSllVWi4u) by 5pm on Wednesday 1st May.
