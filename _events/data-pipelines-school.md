Well-curated and managed data is central to the effective use of AI, in science and elsewhere. How can scientists build the data pipelines they need to accelerate their research with AI?

Accelerate Science’s Data Pipelines for Science School helps scientists overcome such data pipeline challenges by equipping them with the latest best-practice software techniques. It consists of a blend of lectures and labs, with a focus on discussing general principles and case-studies during the lectures, and a focus on hands-on exercises in Python during the labs. Participants also have the opportunity to discuss and share data pipeline issues encountered in their own research with the course instructor and cohort, and to relate it to the course content. The course is open to students and staff at the University of Cambridge.
