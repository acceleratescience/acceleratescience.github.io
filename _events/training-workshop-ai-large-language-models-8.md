This is a 1-day workshop designed to equip you with knowledge of large language models (LLMs) for use in scientific research. The course will introduce LLMs and how they work. Next, we’ll discuss approaches to prompting and RAG, along with the methods that are used to finetune LLMs. The day concludes by covering responsible use and the landscape of models that are available to researchers with some of their pros and cons. After taking this workshop, you will be more confident to take the first steps in using LLMs in your own research.

Open to all postgraduate students and research staff.

Lunch will be provided with the opportunity for networking during the breaks.
