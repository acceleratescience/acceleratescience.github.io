With the increase in AI-generated imagery using models such as Dall-E, Midjourney and Sora and research applications such as AlphaFold, there has been a surge in workflows incorporating models like Stable Diffusion. These models have potential in research applications including drug discovery, weather forecasting, synthetic speech and medical imaging. \
\
The aim of the session will be to equip you with knowledge of how generative AI and diffusion models work and to share an overview of research applications. The workshop will include short talks from researchers already deploying diffusion models in their research. 

Much of the workshop content is conceptual and high-level, and by the end of the day participants will have a firm grasp on how diffusion models work. We won't be coding during the session, but will share code with you for you to work with after the session. To get the most out of the code, and the technical content of the workshop, we recommend that you have some exposure to the following (*but please note, that this is not a requirement to attend*):

* Probability
* Deep learning
* Computer vision
* Language models
* PyTorch

T﻿his event will take place on Thursday 20 June form 09:30 - 17:00 at the William Gates Building. \
