A one day workshop to equip researchers with knowledge of workflows and tools they can use to package and publish their code. Releasing software outputs from your research is an important step for open science and enables other researchers to utilise your code and for your work to have further impact. Participants will have the opportunity for hands on experience packaging and publishing a project.

Participants will require some background knowledge for this course. Experience using python for programming or scientific data analysis is required. You must also have a GitHub account. In addition, experience with building classes, using the command line (either Linux or MacOS), and some understanding of Git would be beneficial, but it is not required.

Open to all postgraduate students and research staff.

Lunch will be provided with the opportunity for networking during the breaks.
