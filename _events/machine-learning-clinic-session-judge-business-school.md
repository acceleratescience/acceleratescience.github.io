Businesses are paying attention to AI, and for good reason! One in six organisations in the UK are using AI technology, while over 3000 UK companies are focused on building AI solutions. In 2022, $3bn in AI investments were made in the UK alone, which receives around 50% of the investment in Europe and is 3rd globally after the US and China.

The Accelerate Programme, based in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, are holding an in-person AI Clinic Session on 23rd of November from 2 – 4pm in the Simon Sainsbury Centre of the Judge Business School. No matter your level of experience with AI, we invite you to come and talk to our team to learn more about AI and its impact in the world.
