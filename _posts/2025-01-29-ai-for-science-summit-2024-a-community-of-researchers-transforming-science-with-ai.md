**AI Powers Scientific Breakthroughs**


AI tools are fundamentally changing how scientists analyse data and make discoveries. Researchers are harnessing AI to advance understanding of complex systems, develop reasoning frameworks, and create robust solutions across fields. Summit participants demonstrated innovative applications that ranged from monitoring illegal wildlife trade to building explainable models for metabolic medicine.


**Scientists Bridge the Expertise Gap**


Computational scientists and domain experts emphasised how their collaboration drives success in AI for science. Their partnerships ensure AI tools directly address critical research questions. Astrophysicists, for example, carefully select between foundation models and multi-modal approaches based on their specific research needs. Such challenges are shared across fields and by sharing knowledge and experiences, researchers can capitalise on the power of AI across disciplinary boundaries.


**Advancing the AI for science field through a global community**


Participants stressed that unleashing AI's full potential demands active engagement throughout the research sector. The community called for:

* AI and domain scientists to forge stronger connections
* Institutions to recognise research software engineers' contributions to driving forward the field
* Universities to reimagine how they support interdisciplinary research
* Research teams to break down disciplinary barriers through open science
* Bidirectional flow of ideas between AI for science and the science of AI


**Momentum Builds**


The summit sparked new connections across disciplines and ignited fresh ideas for collaboration. We hope that these connections can lay foundations for future collaboration and the next steps for the community to move closer to realising the potential of AI for Science.
