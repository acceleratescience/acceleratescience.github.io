title: AI policy and data governance
excerpt: Policy plays a crucial role in influencing where, how and for whose
  benefit machine learning systems are developed and deployed. Safe and reliable
  deployment of machine learning systems requires policy frameworks that embed
  trustworthy data governance; that promote the use of machine learning in areas
  where it has potential to improve public wellbeing; and that account for the
  wider implications of technological change on individuals and communities.
  Research in this theme considers what policy levers can shape the development
  of AI technologies.

overview_short: Policy plays a crucial role in influencing where, how and for
  whose benefit machine learning systems are developed and deployed. Safe and
  reliable deployment of machine learning systems requires policy frameworks
  that embed trustworthy data governance; that promote the use of machine
  learning in areas where it has potential to improve public wellbeing; and that
  account for the wider implications of technological change on individuals and
  communities. Research in this theme considers what policy levers can shape the
  development of AI technologies.

  What policy levers can shape the development of AI technologies for societal
  benefit?


  ML@CL’s policy projects identify policy interventions that can support the development of trustworthy AI technologies and that help share the benefits of AI across society. Working with partners in civil society, national government, and international organisations, our work considers:


  * how technological advances in AI can contribute to policy objectives;

  * the role of data governance and stewardship as a foundation for AI that benefits citizens and society;

  * what national strategies or policy frameworks are needed to support the development of trustworthy AI technologies and their deployment for societal benefit;

  * how to deploy data science and AI in the service of national and international policy goals.
