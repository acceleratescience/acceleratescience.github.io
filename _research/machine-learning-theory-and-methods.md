title: Machine learning theory and methods
excerpt: Probability provides a language to describe our knowledge (or
  ignorance) of the world. To build statistical models, we need to structure our
  knowledge about a specific system such that we can reduce our ignorance using
  observations. These techniques are essential components for building
  interpretable computational structures that can be used for decision making.
  Research in this theme considers the development of probabilistic models and
  methods.
