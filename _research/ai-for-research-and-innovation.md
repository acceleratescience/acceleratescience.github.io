title: AI for research and innovation
excerpt: By analysing complex datasets and uncovering previously unknown
  patterns, machine learning has the potential to accelerate scientific
  discovery across the sciences – from healthcare to climate science,
  fundamental physics to conservation, and more. Realising this potential
  requires action to equip researchers from across disciplines with the skills
  they need to use machine learning in their work, and to build a community of
  practice at the interface of data science and other disciplines. Activities in
  this theme advance research, training, and engagement at the interface of AI
  and the sciences.

  How can AI enhance scientific discovery?


  Activities in this theme advance research, training, and engagement at the interface of AI and the sciences.


  Current areas of research interest include:


  * innovations in Gaussian Processes, dimensionality reduction techniques and their application to challenges in the life sciences;

  * the application of ideas from physics and applied mathematics to develop robust sampling methods;

  * the development of computational methods for interrogating the relationship between cellular morphology and genomics;

  * the application of data science approaches to better understand mental health conditions, including machine learning, network science and NLP;

  * theoretical machine learning to understand String Theory;

  * innovations in modelling and software engineering to support increased accuracy in climate predictions.
