excerpt: 2024 has brought a new wave of excitement about the potential of AI for
  science. Thanks to the continuing support of Schmidt Sciences, the University
  of Cambridge has been positioned to respond to this excitement with a
  portfolio of research, training, and community-building activities convened by
  the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. During year four of this
  programme, weâ€™ve delivered a step-change in our engagement with the Cambridge
  AI for science community. We are pleased to share our 2024 report that
  introduces the highlights from this work.
