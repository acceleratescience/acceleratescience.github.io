excerpt: "This course - Advanced Data Science - looks at the real world
  challenges of data science, separating them into three stages: access, assess
  and address. The stages help in understanding that the data science pipeline
  is not just about the machine learning methods, but the ethical concerns, the
  challenges of data management as well as model fitting."
