Inspired by our work with the Cambridge community and our engagement with international partners, Accelerate is developing a strategic research agenda in AI for science, which we hope will help drive further progress across
projects and institutions. This page gives an overview of our recent workshops convened with the AI for Science community and outputs from these discussions contributing towards an emerging strategic research agenda for the field. 

### Machine Learning for Science: Mathematics at the Interface of Data-driven and Mechanistic Modelling

O﻿berwolfach, June 2023

From 11 - 16 June 2023, 40 participants with expertise in applications of machine learning in the sciences took part in the workshop Machine Learning for Science: Mathematics at the Interface of Data-driven and Mechanistic Modelling, co-organised the , co-organised by Neil Lawrence, Jessica Montgomery, and Bernhard Scholkopf. It set out to consider how mathematical innovations can help produce machine learning tools that can be deployed in support of scientific discovery, creating new interfaces between physical and data-driven modelling approaches.

In support of this objective, the workshop convened three discussion themes — Lessons from the application of machine learning in science; Foundational concepts and emerging methods; Machine learning for Earth and climate science.

A﻿ report summarising discussions and insights form the workshop can be accessed here.

### Machine learning for science: bridging data-driven and mechanistic modelling

Dagstuhl workshop, September 2022

In September 2022, Accelerate Science, with collaborators at the University of Tuebingen and University of Wisconsin Madison, convened 30 researchers from across disciplines at a Dagstuhl workshop on ‘Machine learning for science: bridging data-driven and mechanistic modelling’. Two outputs emerged from these discussions:

* A research agenda that identifies areas where further technology development is needed to create AI tools that can enhance scientific discovery; and
* A roadmap for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to deliver a new wave of progress in AI and its application for scientific discovery.

*A﻿I for Science: An emerging agenda*, the report outlining this emerging agenda and roadmap is available [here](https://acceleratescience.github.io/assets/uploads/ai-for-science-an-emerging-agenda.pdf)and on arXiv:
