title: AI Core Concepts
category: teaching-learning
excerpt: >-
  AI and data-driven techniques have the potential to revolutionise research. AI
  is being used across the entire scientific research lifecycle - speeding up
  literature review, enhancing data analysis, accelerating experimentation,
  generating research hypotheses, simulating physical equations, and directly
  modelling physical phenomena. Researchers across disciplines are looking to
  learn more about AI and understand how they can apply it in their own work.


  This short set of online resources explain some of the core concepts behind AI. They're not a full introduction to the theory and practice of AI, but a starting point for researchers who are interested in exploring applied AI in their work.
