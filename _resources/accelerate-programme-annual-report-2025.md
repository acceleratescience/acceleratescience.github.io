title: Accelerate Programme Annual Report 2025
category: additional-resources
excerpt: 2025 has brought further shifts in the relationship between AI and
  scientific discovery. Questions about how to deploy AI responsibly and
  effectively have moved to the centre of research policy discussions
  internationally, and the University of Cambridge has been at the centre of
  these conversations. Thanks to the ongoing support of Schmidt Sciences, the
  Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery has evolved from a research
  initiative into a recognised hub for thought leadership on AI in science – one
  that offers a distinct vision that reaches across diverse domains, and builds
  a community from the ground up.
