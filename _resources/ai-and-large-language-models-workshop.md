 A one day workshop for researchers interested in using LLMs in their research. The aim of the session will be to equip researchers with knowledge of how LLMs work and how to implement them so you can use them in your own research. The workshop will share insights from the LLM study group convened by Accelerate in Autumn 2023 and will draw together tips for best practice. 

We will be looking at Python code and neural networks so familiarity with Python and some knowledge of machine learning and neural networks is required. We won’t be coding during the session, but will share code with you for you to work with after the session.

T﻿his course is taking place on 26 February 2024. Registration is closed. If you are interested in attending a future course, please contact us on accelerate-mle@cst.cam.ac.uk.
