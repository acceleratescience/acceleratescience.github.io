 A one day workshop for researchers interested in using LLMs in their research. The aim of the session will be to equip researchers with knowledge of how LLMs work and how to implement them so you can use them in your own research. The workshop will share insights from the LLM study group convened by Accelerate in Autumn 2023 and will draw together tips for best practice. 

We will be looking at Python code and neural networks so familiarity with Python and some knowledge of machine learning and neural networks is required. We won’t be coding during the session, but the code that expands on the concepts covered in the workshop can be found in the [large-language-models](https://github.com/acceleratescience/large-language-models) repository.
