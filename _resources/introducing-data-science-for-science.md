category: teaching-learning
excerpt: The Accelerate Programme offers PhDs and postdocs disciplines across
  Cambridge University the opportunity to participate in a 'Data for Science'
  training course. This structured Accelerate-Cambridge Spark Introducing Data
  Science for Research will equips scientists with modern practical data
  analysis skills using Python in a virtual instructor-led accelerated
  masterclass.

**PhD students and postdocs across Cambridge University can apply for this training course, which will equip them will skills in data science for science. This course is currently closed for applications, future course dates will be advertised here.** 

Aimed at helping participants apply data science tools to their own datasets and research problems, the course runs over five weeks. Previous courses have attracted participants from fields including chemistry, biochemistry, physics, engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine and psychology.

**What does the course cover?**\
\
The course aims to give researchers in fields outside computer science the skills they need to use machine learning (ML) in their research, and help them apply data analysis to their own datasets and problems. On the course, you will: use data science techniques on your own datasets and research questions; collaborate on real-world data science challenges in teams; and contribute to a world-leading community of scientists and researchers. You can read more about how some of our recent participants has used the course to advance their work in the ‘How can I..?’ series on [Accelerate’s blog](https://acceleratescience.github.io/blog).

Recent participants also share their experiences of the course in a short video available here. 

Residents will cover 6 modules over a period of 5 weeks:

* Introduction to Python (preparatory module)
* Data Processing with Pandas
* Data Visualisation
* Web Scraping, JSON and APIs
* Introduction to machine learning
* Project & presentation

**What are the entry requirements?**

Participants should be current PhD students or researchers at the University of Cambridge and have basic programming skills (e.g. the ability to use Excel, MATLAB, R or Python). Participants should be available from Monday 16 October - Friday 17 November and can expect to spend 30 hours on the programme each week, including timetabled sessions and periods of independent study.

Completion of the [Python for Science module](https://acceleratescience.github.io/resources/python-programming-for-science.html) is not a pre-requisite for this course, as participants will receive training in the use of Python. However, applicants are required to complete an assessment to demonstrate basic programming skills.

**How is the course delivered?**

To produce this course, the Accelerate Programme is working with Cambridge Spark, an education technology company that specialises in data science and AI training. For further information about Cambridge Spark, please see: [https://cambridgespark.com/about/ ](https://cambridgespark.com/about/)

The course will be run via Zoom, with sessions delivered by Cambridge Spark and their community of mentors.

**How much does the course cost?**
The course costs £2,100 + VAT per participant. For this cohort, the Accelerate Programme are able to offer 50% funding towards the cost, meaning the course will be available to participants for £1,050 + VAT. Please note that payment arrangements must be confirmed before starting the course.
