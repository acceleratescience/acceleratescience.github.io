  A collection of resources for researchers interested in using Diffusion Models
  in their research. 


  With the increase in AI-generated imagery using models such as Dall-E, Midjourney and Sora and research applications such as AlphaFold, there has been a surge in workflows incorporating models like Stable Diffusion. These models have potential in research applications including drug discovery, weather forecasting, synthetic speech and medical imaging.

A [collection of resources](https://docs.science.ai.cam.ac.uk/diffusion-models/) for researchers interested in using Diffusion Models in their research. 

With the increase in AI-generated imagery using models such as Dall-E, Midjourney and Sora and research applications such as AlphaFold, there has been a surge in workflows incorporating models like Stable Diffusion. These models have potential in research applications including drug discovery, weather forecasting, synthetic speech and medical imaging.

These resources came out of a study group which Accelerate convened in Spring 2024. This group drew together researchers from across the University with an interest in diffusion models. 

Building on insights from the study group, we developed a one day in-person workshop to equip researchers with knowledge of how diffusion models work and how to implement them for use in their own research. Topics covered this session include how generative AI and diffusion models work and to share an overview of research applications.

Future workshop dates will be shared on our [events page.](https://science.ai.cam.ac.uk/events)
