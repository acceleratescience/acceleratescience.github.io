title: Publishing and Packaging Python Code for Research
category: teaching-learning
excerpt: >-
  A collection of resources for researchers interested in publishing and
  packaging python code for research.


  Accelerate Science have developed a one day course for researchers interested in building knowledge of workflows and tools they can use to package and publish their code. Releasing software outputs from your research is an important step for open science and enables other researchers to utilise your code and for your work to have further impact. These materials explore the importance of sharing code in line with FAIR principles for research software. The course provides a step by step guide to publishing your code using the package Poetry and will walk though an example project.

A collection of resources for researchers interested in publishing and packaging python code for research.

Accelerate Science have developed a one day course for researchers interested in building knowledge of workflows and tools they can use to package and publish their code. Releasing software outputs from your research is an important step for open science and enables other researchers to utilise your code and for your work to have further impact. These materials explore the importance of sharing code in line with FAIR principles for research software. The course provides a step by step guide to publishing your code using the package Poetry and will walk though an example project examining key steps of: 

o	Version control and GitHub Actions
o	Testing
o	Documentation
o	CI/CD

You can find the full course materials and code [here. ](https://docs.science.ai.cam.ac.uk/packaging-publishing/)

Participants will require some background knowledge for this course. Experience using python for programming or scientific data analysis is required. You must also have a GitHub account. In addition, experience with building classes, using the command line (either Linux or MacOS), and some understanding of Git would be beneficial, but it is not required.

Future workshop dates will be shared on our [events page.](https://science.ai.cam.ac.uk/events)
